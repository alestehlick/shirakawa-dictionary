  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 坂 takes 反 as its phonetic, indicating the on reading han. In archaic form 反 depicts a hand (mata) braced against a cliff-like face (the form of a cliff), poised to claw upward; from this image, 坂 came to name terrain shaped like such a face—hence a slope or hill. Expressions such as sakamichi (a road formed by a slope) and kyuhan (a steep incline) preserve this sense. The Shuowen records the older graph 阪, explaining it as something steep and as valleys or barriers—that is, slopes and banks. The original form of 阪 is linked to the “gods’ ladder,” the device by which deities ascend and descend between heaven and earth, suggesting a ceremonial incline set up at sacred places. 坂 does not appear in the Shuowen; 阪 is the original character, with 坂 created later, and in Japan 坂 became the commonly used form."
