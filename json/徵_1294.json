  "explanation": "The original graph is 徵, a compound of 彳, the roadway, 攴, the striking hand, and 呈, a long‑haired figure indicating an elder. It depicts an ancient coercive rite: catching an enemy elder in the street and beating him to stir his spiritual power and compel the fulfillment of one’s demand. From this act of compulsion arose the senses “to demand” and, by extension, “to summon”; from the visible manifestation of the rite’s efficacy, it also came to mean a “sign,” “token,” or “proof.” The punitive nuance of the act further underlies the related character 懲, “to discipline, punish.”"
