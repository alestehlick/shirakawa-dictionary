  "explanation": "This character combines the frontal figure of a person standing with arms and legs outstretched (大) and an opened covenant vessel—a sacred container for written oaths—shown with its lid removed to mark the oath as invalid. In ancient trials by ordeal, disputants swore before the gods; when a claim proved false, the loser (the person, 大) was put to death and, together with the invalidated writing, cast away along with the opened vessel. From this ritual act arose the original sense “to throw away,” which then broadened to leaving a place—“to go away, depart”—and further to the idea of time passing, “the past.” Related characters preserve facets of this scene: 法 evokes casting off into water, and 却 the removal of the defeated person."
