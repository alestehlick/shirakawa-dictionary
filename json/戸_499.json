  "explanation": "戸 is a pictograph of a single-leaf, swinging door—the hinged panel of a household deity board or small shrine (kamidana). In contrast to 門, the double-leaf gate, this single door marked the sacred threshold separating the inner and outer realms. Oracle-bone inscriptions even record worship at triple shrines as 三戸 or 三門. From this cultic setting developed related graphs: 啓 originally depicted opening such a door by hand to consult a sacred receptacle (sai) that held covenant petitions to the gods, and by extension came to mean receiving a divine message; 肇 expressed the beginning of receiving such revelation. Because every dwelling contained such a sacred place, 戸 naturally came to signify a household unit, as in 一戸, extending from the concrete “door” to the idea of “household” and “family.”"
