  "explanation": "The traditional form 圖 sets an inner element within an enclosing frame. The outer 囗 marks a bounded tract, while the inner component is 啚—the base that also appears in 鄙 (hi, “country; base”), and itself incorporates the sign 亩, the figure of a grain elevator, alongside a mouth element. Together they depict a mapped area with the location of a granary inscribed. From this image of a laid‑out site and its marked installation point, the character came to mean a plan or map, and by extension an illustration or drawing, as well as the act of drawing. Because such facilities are placed according to prior design, the graph further developed the sense “to plan; to measure,” and it is also used for “books; writings,” as in terms for library materials."
