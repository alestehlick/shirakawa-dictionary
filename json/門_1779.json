  "explanation": "This character is a pictograph of a pair of hinged leaves forming a double door. As the ancient Explanation of Names notes, men means to push, conjuring a doorway that opens by being pushed. From the concrete sense of a gate or entrance, the word naturally expanded to signify the house that has that entrance, and then, by association, the family or kin who live within. In contrast, 戸 (戶) depicts a single swinging door."
