  "explanation": "In the earliest script forms, 辛 sketches a large, handled needle—the instrument for tattooing. As the emblem of punitive tattooing, it served as a potent ritual sign: set above the graph of a covenant vessel into which written prayers were placed, it formed characters for solemn vows made before the gods. Placed on a woman’s brow it produced 妾, originally indicating a woman consecrated as an offering. The old writing of 罪 combined 辛 with 自 “nose,” picturing facial tattooing as punishment and thus coming to mean “crime.” From the pain and severity of tattooing, 辛 came to express “hard, severe,” and by extension in taste, “spicy, pungent, even salty.” It is also the eighth of the Ten Heavenly Stems (kanoto)."
