  "explanation": "懇 is a phono-semantic character: the heart component signals the realm of feeling, while the phonetic kon comes from 墾, whose ancient image evokes a wild boar in a fury, rooting up soil and crops with its tusks—digging deep to the very roots. Transferred to the heart, this becomes the idea of feelings worked and delved into thoroughly, hence wholehearted sincerity, careful attentiveness, and cordial, earnest regard."
