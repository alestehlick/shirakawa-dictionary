  "explanation": "Originally written 踐, this is a phono-semantic character combining the foot element with 戔 as the phonetic, which signals the On reading sen. 戔 depicts long, narrow pikes (戈) stacked up, suggesting a state of flat things piled one upon another. Set beside the foot component, it evokes footprints overlapping—steps heaped up in succession—hence the senses “to tread,” “to trample,” and “to walk.” This imagery connects to ritual practice: in Japan, the henbai rite (反閇/反閉) consisted of stamping the floor to pacify the earth spirit, a practice corresponding to what ancient China called 践土. In formal ceremonies one advanced in measured steps, described as 履践, “to perform, to conduct,” and from this ritual comportment the character naturally extended to mean carrying something out or implementing it."
