  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads the 白 element in 伯 as the on-reading indicator for haku and traces its form to a skull, bleached white as wind and rain stripped away the flesh. In antiquity, the skulls of eminent leaders or defeated enemy chiefs were preserved as white-bone relics, thought to retain powerful spiritual—indeed, curse-like—force. From this veneration of the head of an outstanding person, 伯 came to mean “head, chief,” and in the Zhou system of sibling order it denoted the eldest brother (伯, followed by 仲, 叔, 季). The character thus extends to compounds like 伯父, referring to an elder uncle, and underlies later titles such as the noble “count.”"
