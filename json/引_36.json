  "explanation": "A compound graph formed from 弓, a bow, and a single straight stroke understood as the taut bowstring. Even without securely attested archaic forms, the composition vividly pictures drawing the string of a bow. Other graphs that once shared its on reading also evoke the act of pulling a bowstring, reinforcing this image. From that concrete scene, the sense broadened to pulling by physical strength in general, and further to actions such as leading or drawing back."
