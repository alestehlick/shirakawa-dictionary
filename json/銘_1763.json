  "explanation": "A phono-semantic formation, 銘 places the metal sign 金 beside 名, which gives the on reading mei. It means to write down or engrave, above all the act of cutting a record into bronze. In the sphere of ritual bronzes this embraced prayers to ancestors, imperial appointments (sakumei) by the Son of Heaven, enfeoffments, and transfers of land or people—weighty affairs preserved as enduring documents on vessels. The Shuowen’s later appendix glosses it simply as “to write down, to inscribe,” and the graph names both the act and the engraved text. Classical accounts capture the intent: one casts a ritual yi vessel, engraves the achievements upon it, and thereby shows them to one’s descendants. From this ceremonial origin, 銘 came to signify inscriptions and, by extension, admonitory mottoes meant to be engraved on objects or impressed upon the heart."
