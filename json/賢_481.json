  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 賢 as a phono-semantic compound with 臥 as the phonetic element giving the on-reading ken. In archaic forms, 臥 shows a hand (又) inserted into 臣, the eye turned upward with a large pupil, evoking the ritual blinding of a person dedicated to divine service; 臣 thus denotes attendants serving the gods. Among such servants were individuals of extraordinary gifts, and 臥 originally referred to these outstanding figures and, by extension, to wisdom itself. When the prized cowry shell 貝—brought from the distant southern seas and used as precious currency—was added, the character emphasized high value. Hence 賢, “臥” plus “貝,” came to signify a person of prized, superior ability: wise, clever, and excelling others."
