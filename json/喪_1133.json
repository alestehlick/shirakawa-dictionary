  "explanation": "In early forms, 喪 is composed of 哭, the act of lamentation, joined with 亡, the figure of the dead with limbs drawn in. In 哭, the upper element shows a pair of covenant vessels set out for the gods, while below is a dog offered in sacrifice; this combination evokes ritual weeping before sacred offerings. Placed with 亡, the whole depicts the funeral rite itself—vessels arrayed, a sacrificial dog presented, and mourners crying—hence the meanings of mourning and being in mourning, and by extension death. In bronze inscriptions, 喪 also writes 葬, “to bury,” as seen on the Mão Qi vessel, and oracle-bone texts ask about loss with phrases such as 喪衆 “Will the people be lost?” and 喪師 “Will the army be lost?” From these uses the character further develops senses like “to lose,” “to perish,” and “to destroy.”"
