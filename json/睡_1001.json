  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character in which 垂 acts as the phonetic, giving the on-reading sui. 垂 originally depicts flowers or leaves hanging down, and that image of drooping is transferred to the eyelids: 睡 describes the lids sinking as drowsiness comes on, hence the sense of sleep. Sleep was regarded as serene and beautiful, reflected in compounds such as 睡鷗, the sea gull quietly floating on the water, and 睡蓮, the water lily that opens and closes on the water."
