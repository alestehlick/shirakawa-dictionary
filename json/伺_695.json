  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph formed with the person element and 司. Here 司 supplies the on reading shi and evokes its older sense: an officiant presiding over rites, intoning prayers and petitions to the gods. 伺 thus depicts a person who approaches and sounds out the divine will, which gives the core meaning ukagau, to inquire. The nuance of seeking a sign by looking out into the distance is felt in compounds with 望, as in 伺望, and it extends to observing another’s intentions and conduct, as in 伺察. By association it can also stand in the place of 覗, to look or peep."
