  "explanation": "詐 is a phono-semantic character built from 言, “speech,” and the phonetic 乍, read sa. The graph 乍 depicts a small tree branch forced to bend, as when making a fence—an image of human effort changing a thing’s original form. With 言 added, that notion of forced change is applied to words: speech that is bent, pledges or promises that are altered, hence the senses “to deceive” and “to lie.” In the compound 詐欺 (sagi), 詐 conveys the bending of facts and false speech, while 欺 evokes a large, four-cornered mask set over the face, the act of duping another."
