  "explanation": "This graph combines the shrine roof 宀 with a human figure 人 and the head 頁. It pictures a mourner seen in profile within an ancestral mausoleum, a ritual headband tied around the head, paying respects to the departed—some old forms even show tears flowing. From this image it came to mean a widow; the Book of Rites glosses 寡 as “old and without a husband.” Together with 鰥 (widower), 孤 (orphan), and 独 (the aged without children), it designated those bereft and thus in need of care. Because a widow was thought of as “one with little fortune,” the sense broadened to “few, scant,” and by extension “weak, small.” In classical usage rulers styled themselves modestly as 寡人, “my poor self.” The on reading ka stands close in feel to the ko of 孤, and the character also carries overtones of solitude."
