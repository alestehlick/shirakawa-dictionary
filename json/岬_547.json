  "explanation": "岬 is a phono-semantic character: the mountain radical signals a landform, while 甲 functions as the phonetic element, giving the Sino-Japanese reading ko. Early lexica such as the Yu Pian gloss it as the side of mountains, specifically a place between mountains, a valley. In Japanese usage it came to be read misaki and refers to a cape or promontory, the tip of land thrusting out into the water."
