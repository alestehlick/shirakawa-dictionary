  "explanation": "In its earliest form, 夫 is a pictograph of a man with a hairpin thrust through his topknot. It builds on the graph 大—the front view of a person with arms and legs outstretched—by adding a short stroke at the crown to mark the ceremonial hairpin, depicting a man in full formal dress. A complementary character, 妻, shows a woman arranging three hairpins in her coiffure with the help of a hand (又), the image of bridal finery. Together, 夫 and 妻 present bridegroom and bride in wedding attire, from which 夫 came to mean “husband,” and by extension “man.” The character also appears in respectful titles such as 夫人 (“Lady,” an honorific for another’s wife) and 夫子 (“Master,” for an elder or learned teacher). In classical usage it further serves as a particle: an opening exclamation at the start of speech (“sore”) and a sentence-final note of lament or emphasis (“kana”)."
