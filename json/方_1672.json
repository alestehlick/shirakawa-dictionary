  "explanation": "Shirakawa understands 方 as a pictograph of a dead person suspended from a horizontal beam. Such figures were erected at border places as curse-barriers to ward off evil spirits, so the graph first evoked the outer, distant regions (totsukuni) and then naturally came to mean a direction (as in hôi, hôgaku, hôkô). From the sense of a course one follows it further developed the meanings of way and method (as in hôhô). This ritual background also clarifies related graphs: 放 initially referred to beating the suspended figure to drive away malign forces; 白 depicts a skull; and 敫 shows a skull hung up and struck on a post in an exorcistic rite."
