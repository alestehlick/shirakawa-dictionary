  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats 荷 as a phono-semantic character with 何 as its phonetic core. In ancient forms of 何, one finds the image of a person shouldering a halberd (戈), which gave the graph the sense of “to bear, to carry.” With that phonetic and semantic force, 荷 comes to mean a burden or load and the act of carrying it (ni, ninau). When used as a plant name, the same graph denotes the lotus (hasu). The on reading ka reflects the value provided by 何."
