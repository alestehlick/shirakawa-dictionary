  "explanation": "This character is a pictograph showing assorted grains—both glutinous broomcorn millet and non‑glutinous millet—piled high on a tall-footed ritual vessel (豆). Such heaped offerings were presented in worship, and the image of a vessel brimming with grain naturally conveyed “plenty,” giving the senses of abundance and richness; from this it also came to be used for “large” and “flourishing.” The same graph serves as the right-hand element in 醴 (rei/li), the sweet rice liquor known as amazake, where it contributes the nuance of rich, ample sweetness."
