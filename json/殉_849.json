  "explanation": "殉 is a phono-semantic compound. On the left, 歹 shows the upper part of a skeleton—the remains of a corpse—while 死, in its original form, depicts a person paying reverence to those remains. On the right, 旬 supplies the sound jun and also evokes the sense of moving in sequence or following, which here is extended to the act of following a person into death. Hence 殉 came to mean to die for or with one’s lord, as in 殉死 (the retainer’s suicide after a ruler’s death), and 殉葬 (interment as an attendant in the same burial). In the tombs of the Shang kings, young people were sometimes buried as such companions, likely to impart vitality to the deceased ruler; in later times, clay figures were used in their stead."
