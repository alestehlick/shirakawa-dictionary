  "explanation": "A pictograph of the moon as it appears in the evening—a slim three-day crescent—this character names the time of dusk and evening. To set it apart from the round form of the sun (日), early scribes drew the moon as a crescent; in oracle-bone and tortoise-shell inscriptions, 夕 is marked by a small dot within the crescent, while 月 lacks that dot. In later script the contrast was fixed as 夕 with a single dot-like stroke and 月 with two. In the Yin period, morning and evening rites greeted the sun and moon respectively, and meals were taken at those times; since state affairs were conducted at the morning rite, the term 朝政, “morning governance,” came to mean political business. Against this cultural backdrop, 夕 naturally came to signify the evening."
