  "explanation": "This is a phono-semantic character built on 酋 as the phonetic, which signals the on-reading yuu and originally referred to ritual liquor offered to the gods. The earliest form of the graph is written 猶, but in bronze inscriptions it often appears as 猷, depicting a dog offered together with libations—an image of worship and divination to seek the gods’ will. Hence in the Zong Zhou Zhong inscription we find 朕猷, “my plan,” where the word denotes a plan or stratagem derived from divine consultation. Over time the two graphs were interchanged and then differentiated: 猷 came to be used specifically for ‘plan/stratagem,’ while 猶, in association with 由, developed adverbial senses such as ‘still, yet, moreover,’ and, through association with 誘, it could also shade into meanings like ‘to entice or delude.’"
