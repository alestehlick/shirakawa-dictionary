  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 且 as a pictograph of a sacrificial board. Its fuller figure appears in 俎, showing a chopping board with pieces of meat laid upon it. In early script two 夕—used as an abbreviated form of 肉, “meat”—are set on this board to depict an offering performed in the ancestral mausoleum where the spirits are kept. From this ritual context, 且 could even denote the ancestors themselves in antiquity. As the character drifted from its ceremonial roots, it came to be used adverbially for “and/also,” and by extension gained senses such as “for a short while” and “just about to.”"
