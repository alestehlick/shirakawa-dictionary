  "explanation": "Originally a pictograph of a nose seen from the front, this graph took on the sense of “self” because people traditionally pointed to the nose when referring to themselves. In oracle-bone inscriptions it already appears in the construction 自…至…, meaning “from … to …,” with 自 functioning as “from.” As the character came to be used primarily for “self, oneself,” a new graph, 鼻, was created to write “nose,” formed by adding 畀 beneath 自 as a phonetic element, evoking the sound of nasal breathing."
