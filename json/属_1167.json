  "explanation": "The original form 屬 combines 尾, the image of an animal with its tail stretched out (marking the female), with 蜀, a male animal whose inner 虫 graph depicts the male organ. The picture is of male and female joining, and from this concrete union the character broadened to mean things ranging in a row, continuing in sequence, and being linked or connected. By extension it came to express sticking or adhering, drawing near, and attachment in the social sense—belonging to a group or being left in someone’s charge. The derivative 嘱 (traditional 囑), with the mouth element added, channels this idea into the act of requesting or entrusting by speech."
