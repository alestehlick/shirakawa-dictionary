  "explanation": "府 is a phono-semantic character written under the “house” radical, with 付 supplying the sound. Early sources define it as a storehouse or repository: a place where important writings were safeguarded. The Zuo Zhuan notes that covenant texts were deposited in the Zhou fu—the royal archive and treasury of the Zhou dynasty—highlighting its role as the secure custodian of state documents. From this core sense it broadened to mean official premises and government offices, as in 府署, 官府, and 政府; in compounds like 首府 it points to the seat of government, the capital."
