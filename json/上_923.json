  "explanation": "This character began as an indicative sign built on a hand: a small mark placed above the outstretched palm simply pointed to “what is above.” Its counterpart 下 marked below the hand. Over time the pointing dots lengthened into vertical strokes, yielding simple line forms, and with an added side dot the graphs settled into the recognizable shapes 上 and 下. From the concrete sense of the space above the palm, 上 broadened to mean the upward direction and actions of lifting, raising, and ascending; in space, the upper part or top; in time, the beginning and antiquity; and in human relations, those of higher rank, along with nuances of reverent offering, esteem, and excelling."
