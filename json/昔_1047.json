  "explanation": "The character originally depicts thin slices of meat laid out to dry in the sun. On that shape it became the graphic base for 腊, “preserved meat,” formed by adding the meat classifier 月 to create a phono-semantic compound. By loan, 昔 then came to express temporal relations that are hard to picture—“long ago,” “for a long time,” and even “yesterday,” as seen in 疇昔 (“once; formerly”). This same reliance on phonetic borrowing underlies conventional pairings like 今 (kon/kin, “now”) and 昔, familiar in expressions such as 今昔."
