  "explanation": "A phono-semantic compound: the left side is the heart radical, signaling a feeling or state of mind, while the right component 夬 (written in old forms like 圣) serves as the phonetic for kai. That right element shows a hand (又) set above earth (土), pointing to rites for the tutelary spirit of the soil. In contrast to a graph associated with clearing fields, this one evokes the ceremony of worshipping the earth guardian. When something uncanny was sensed around that deity, it stirred unease in the heart; with the heart radical added, the character came to express the uncanny or dubious—hence “strange,” “suspicious,” and the verb “to suspect.”"
