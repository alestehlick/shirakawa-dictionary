  "explanation": "A phono-semantic compound: on the left, the two-stroke water sign 冫 marks ice and cold; on the right, 疑 serves as the phonetic and portrays a person hesitating, turning back with a cane, an image of arrested motion. Combined, they evoke stillness as hard as frozen ice. From this core sense of freezing, the character extends to congealing and becoming stiff, to fixing or solidifying, and by extension to concentrating or being absorbed."
