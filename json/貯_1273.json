  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 貯 as a phono-semantic graph built on 宁, which depicts a storage box and also supplies the sound value cho. In oracle-bone forms the box is shown with cowry shells placed inside; some bronze forms instead depict a pike set within the box. Because the cowry (貝) was a precious shell used as money, adding 貝 to the “box” graph naturally yields the sense of laying valuables by in store. Bronze inscriptions even use 貯 as a noun for a storage facility, as in an order to oversee the construction of a new storehouse. From these early images the character came to mean to store, to lay up, and by extension savings."
