  "explanation": "拝 is a compound graph formed by two hands set around the figure of a solitary flower, like the blossom depicted in 藜 on a single stem. It originally pictured bending down and pulling up a flower or tuft of grass, hence the sense “to pluck, to pull out.” Because that stooped, lowered-head posture matches the stance of formal obeisance, the character came to mean “to worship, to make a reverent bow.” Bronze inscriptions show it in court investiture rites, where the appointee performed haishu keishu—placing hands and head to the ground in veneration."
