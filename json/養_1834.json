  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character with sheep (羊) as the phonetic element, which gives the on-yomi yō, 養 fundamentally means to provide for and bring up. Early lexica gloss it as supplying food and rearing, and extend the sense to upbringing, cultivation, protection, comfort, and even livestock, reflecting a pastoral origin. In the oracle-bone and bronze forms, a sheep is shown together with a striking or whip element (the boku component), vividly suggesting the tending and management of sheep—the concrete image behind the broader idea of nourishing and fostering."
