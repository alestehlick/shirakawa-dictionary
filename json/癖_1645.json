  "explanation": "癖 is a phono-semantic character: the sickness radical 疒 suggests an enduring condition, while 辟 (heki) supplies the sound. In Shirakawa’s view, 辟 incorporates 辛, the small crooked knife used in punishments, and depicts the penalty of slicing flesh from a person’s waist, the person shown by 尸 in profile. From this arises the image of a body that can no longer stand straight; 僻 (heki) names that warped, leaning posture. 癖 extends this from a physical bent to a fixed bent of character—the posture that turns into habit—hence its meaning kuse, a habitual quirk or tendency."
