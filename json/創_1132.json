  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 創 as a phonetic compound: 倉 serves as the sound element (sou), and 刀 is the blade. In archaic usage the word referred to a wound, especially the gash made by a spear or lance. Alongside it there once existed a separate graph that pictured opening the frame of a casting mold (井) with a knife to take out the vessel inside; from that image came the senses “to begin” and “to create.” That older character fell out of use, and 創, originally the “wound” graph, absorbed its meanings. Variant forms such as 刱 are also attested."
