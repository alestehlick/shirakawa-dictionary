  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 謡 combines the speech element 言 with the phonetic 遙 (yō). In its older form, this phonetic depicts meat (月) set upon a hotogi earthenware vessel (缶) as a festival offering, an image that evoked solemn prayers—words uttered in rites, even in the sense of invoking a curse. From these ritual utterances, arranged to a tune, the meaning naturally broadened to “to sing” and “song.” In early usage, 童謡 were “wazauta,” purposeful songs that could carry political satire or foretell social events. In Japanese today, 謡 refers especially to Noh chanting, as in 謡曲 and utai."
