  "explanation": "A pictograph of a dog, drawn as a sturdy, powerful animal—likely the hunting dogs of antiquity. In Yin and Zhou royal tombs, dogs were interred as sacrifices, sometimes alongside soldiers, to guard the king; rites called Fuku (伏) and Fuku-ei (伏瘞) buried a person with a dog to pin down baleful spirits hidden in the earth. In the Warring States period, cherished dogs were even buried with gold and silver ornaments, and the dog sacrifice was regarded as especially noble. In high ritual for worshipping the supreme deity in heaven, grain was offered and a sacrificial dog was burned so that its fragrance rose skyward; purification with a dog also consecrated new buildings and newly made vessels. This consecratory role of 犬 is preserved in several graphs: 就 marks the use of a sacrificial dog at the completion of a fortress gate (京); 器 a vessel purified by such a dog; 獻 a tripod-like offering vessel purified in this way; and 猷 a plan in which a dog is added to fragrant wine (酋) to seek the gods’ will. A puppy is 狗, just as a foal is 駒. In later standardized forms (for example, in characters like 類 and 器), the 犬 element was sometimes replaced by the human-shaped 大, and the original ritual nuance was lost."
