  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 刑 as growing from the image of restraint. In early forms the graph depicts a shackle or stock—fitted to the neck or hands to deprive movement—and some ancient variants even add separate hand restraints. Thus the word originally meant the act of imposing such confinement as a judicial penalty. As punishments that cut or maimed the body—severing the nose or ears, decapitation, cutting at the waist—came to prevail, a knife element 刀 (written as 刂 on the right) was added to the shackle sign, producing the later form 刑 and fixing its sense as “punishment.”"
