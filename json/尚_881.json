  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 尚 as a compound of 向 and 八. In early forms, 向 shows a ritual sai—a covenant vessel for written prayers—set at a window where light streams in as one worships the gods. The 八 marks the sign that appears and seems to hang in the air. Thus 尚 depicts the faint manifestation of a divine sign at that sacred moment. This epiphany, associated with a trance-like state during supplication, gave rise to senses such as to esteem and high, and by extension the adverbial uses still, yet, and furthermore."
