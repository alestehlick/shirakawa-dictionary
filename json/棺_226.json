  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 棺 as a phono-semantic character: the wood element marks a wooden object, while 官 supplies the sound kan and recalls its archaic form—a structure where sacrificial meat, borne with an army on campaign, was installed within a military post—carrying, by association with 綰 (“to bind, bundle”), the sense of enclosing and tying. From this, 棺 names the wooden chest that holds a shrouded body. The related character 椁 is the outer case into which the inner 棺 is placed; together 棺椁 refers to the double coffin set used for high-ranking burials. In contrast, the word 葬 (“funeral”) reflects the practice for commoners of leaving the body to weather and later gathering the bones for burial."
