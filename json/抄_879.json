  "explanation": "抄 is a phono-semantic character: the hand component 扌 shows the act of taking, while 少 serves as the phonetic and points to its old image of small shells threaded on a cord—gathering scattered shells together. From this, the graph came to express a light, selective kind of taking, like scooping up small things, hence meanings such as “to scoop” and “to skim.” By extension it was used for making extracts and copies. In Japan, 抄物 referred to Muromachi-period records of Zen monks’ lectures, valuable sources for the earliest forms of the spoken language."
