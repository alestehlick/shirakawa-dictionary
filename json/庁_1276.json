  "explanation": "This is a phono-semantic character whose original form is 廳, built with 聽 (聴) as its phonetic. 聴 evokes wise, inspired listening—the attentiveness that can catch the voices of the deities—so 廳 came to designate the place where matters were listened to and adjudicated: the government office that conducted hearings and judged lawsuits. Classical glosses also extend it to the reception hall or drawing room (客廳), a space for receiving guests. The modern form 庁 preserves this sense of a public hall and administrative office."
