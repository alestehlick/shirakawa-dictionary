  "explanation": "This is a phono-semantic character. In its original form 途, the element 余 functions as the phonetic, signaling the On reading to; characters such as 荼 “to” (a bitter herb, nigana) and 涂 “to” (a ‘way’ at water) share this same phonetic. Shirakawa interprets 余 as the image of a large, handled needle used in a ritual known as jodo, “way-piercing”: the needle is driven into the ground to purge malevolent forces hidden beneath the soil. 涂 depicts performing this rite at a watercourse, while 途 places it on a roadway. From this ritual of piercing and purification, both characters come to mean a road or way that has been exorcised and made safe."
