  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 宅 as a picto-phonetic character: beneath the protective roof 宀 stands 乇, the phonetic that gives the on reading taku. But 乇 is more than a sound; it was traditionally described as a sprouting leaf, a sign tied to divinatory practice, and in related characters like 託 it points to receiving a divine charge. Within this view, the lower element in 宅 evokes a sacred structure—specifically the mausoleum where ancestors are venerated—serving as the site for consulting the gods. Oracle-bone inscriptions even record inquiries made “in the new mausoleum,” showing it as a place for seeking and receiving revelatory messages. Accordingly, 宅 first meant a place permeated by the divine will, a locus of sacred presence. Only later did its sense broaden to the human sphere: the place where one is and lives—the dwelling, house, or residence."
