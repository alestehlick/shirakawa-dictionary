  "explanation": "This character began as a pictograph of removing a helmet. Early forms show the headgear being lifted off—a gesture of formal respect when troops greeted each other in formation. From that concrete act of taking something off grew the senses of being freed from it: to escape, be spared, or be exempt, and by extension to excuse or grant permission. Though ancient writings preserve two graphic lineages of the form, both point back to the same image of a helmet being taken away."
