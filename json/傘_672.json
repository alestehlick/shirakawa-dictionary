  "explanation": "A pictograph of an open umbrella with its ribs splayed, this character captures the protective canopy itself. Because the object was introduced from China, it could specifically evoke the karakasa, the Tang-style Chinese umbrella. The sun-shading variety is called higasa. From the image of a broad canopy sheltering many, 傘下 came to mean gathering under the protection of a powerful figure. The form 繖 (san) denotes a silk umbrella—originally a ceremonial parasol of the nobility, later commonly used in monastic functions."
