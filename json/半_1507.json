  "explanation": "In the oldest script, 半 is a pictograph of an ox cleaved straight down the middle as a sacrificial offering. From this vivid image came the senses of dividing and, by extension, half or the midway point. With the flesh radical 月 added, as in 胖, it points to “half a body”—meat from the sacrificed ox—and later came to suggest plumpness or abundance. Relatedly, 分 combines 八, the sign of something parted left and right, with 刀 “knife,” to express cutting in two. 半 thus embodies the fundamental idea of halving through division."
