  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 需 as a compound of 雨, “rain,” and 而, which depicts a person with hair cut short and no topknot—the emblem of a shaman (fushuku) serving the deities. Shamans conducted rain-invoking rites under clear skies, so the graph originally evoked the act of imploring and awaiting rain and, by extension, came to mean to demand and to wait. The related character 儒 first referred to such ritual specialists engaged in rain prayers. In some traditions the rite went as far as burning the shaman as a sacrifice; Shirakawa sees 美 as a graph portraying a shaman killed by fire."
