  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the old form 愼 sets the heart element beside 眞 as the sound. In 眞, the graph combines the sign for a fallen dead person and an inverted hanging head, evoking someone struck by sudden calamity and lying dead in the street. Such a death was feared for the fierce power of its spirit, so the body was buried, a small shrine (祠) was set up, the deceased was respectfully placed within, a spirit-charged jewel (玉) was affixed, and rites of pacification (鎭/鎮) were performed. 慎 expresses the sincere, restrained attitude with which one handles such a death—hence the sense of being prudent and careful."
