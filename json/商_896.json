  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 商 as a ritual scene. The character combines 辛, the large tattooing needle that signified judicial authority, set upon a stand, with 口 used not as a mouth but as a covenant vessel that held written petitions to the gods. Displaying the punitive needle and placing the covenant receptacle before it evokes a solemn act of prayerful consultation, so the original sense is to seek the will of the deities, to consult. In the oracle-bone inscriptions, 商 is also the formal name of the Shang polity, whose capital is styled 大邑商, the Great City of Shang. From contexts of prize-giving and compensatory offerings—reciprocal settlements made to redress or conclude matters—the word broadened into the notion of transaction, and in time came to mean selling and trade, hence commerce."
