  "explanation": "基 is a phono-semantic character. The upper 其, originally depicting a square dustpan set on a stand, provides the sound ki and also suggests something squarely set up to bear weight. The lower 土 is earth. Together they evoke an earthen platform laid down as the fundament of a building, hence the sense of a base or foundation (moto, motoi). In ancient rites, the act called tenki (奠基) consecrated such a platform by burying a sacrificial offering, often a dog or the like, to purify and secure the ground."
