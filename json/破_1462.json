  "explanation": "破 is a phono-semantic compound: the left side 石 evokes stone, while the right side 皮 serves as the phonetic, giving the sound ha and originally depicting hands peeling an animal hide. Early lexica describe it as “breaking stone into pieces” (Shuowen) and “dissociating” or “flaking off” (Yupian), with Guangya glossing it as “to tear.” From the image of a stone surface spalling away like a hide being peeled, the character came to mean to break, split, or tear, and by extension to destroy and to defeat. The role of 皮 as phonetic is seen in related characters such as 坡 and 跛, which share the same on-reading cue."
