  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: the animal radical marks a beast, while 袁 (also written as 爰), which shares the on reading en, supplies the sound. Related forms such as 蝯 are also seen. The link with 爰 is especially telling, as it is the phonetic in 援, evoking reaching, grasping, and hauling up—apt images for a monkey with long arms, skilled at taking things and climbing trees. In ancient China, the animal was also written 狻."
