  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 盗 as a compound graph whose earliest form pairs 次 with a dish of blood. 次 itself combines water with a figure shown mouth agape and drooling—the same imagery that underlies the character for slobber—while the dish signifies blood set out for a solemn rite. Put together, 盗 depicts saliva defiling the blood in a ritual bowl at a blood-oath ceremony. From this vivid scene it came to mean the one who desecrates and breaks a sworn pact: a traitor to the community. In early usage, refugees and defectors could be branded 盗, and even Confucius, during his periods of exile, was treated as such. Closely related is 賊, which shows a sacred oath engraved on a bronze tripod being gouged with a halberd—another image of oath-breaking. Both graphs originally denoted public criminals; only later did 盗 develop its common senses of “to steal” and “thief.”"
