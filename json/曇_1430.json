  "explanation": "曇 combines the elements for sun (日) and cloud (雲), depicting sunlight being veiled by clouds. From this image it naturally came to mean to cloud over and cloudiness. It appears in words such as donten, a cloudy sky, and the classical binome 曇曇 for a dark, heavily overcast day. In Buddhist literature it is also seen in Udonge (優曇華), the udumbara, a legendary flower said to bloom only once in three thousand years."
