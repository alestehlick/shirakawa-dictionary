  "explanation": "淑 is a phono-semantic character: the water element sets the field of meaning, while 叔 serves as the phonetic, signaling the on-reading shuku. The Shuowen glosses it as water turning crystal-clear, and from that image it came to describe moral and aesthetic clarity—goodness, modesty, and a gentle, beautiful bearing. In bronze inscriptions, this same word is at times written with 弔, a pictograph of a bow with a coiling retrieval cord (繳, shaku) used to ensnare game. Because the sound of 繳 (shaku) is close to that of 淑 (shuku/shū), 弔 functioned as a loan graph for 淑. This loan use underlies expressions like 不弔 in the Odes, where it conveys “not blessed, unfortunate,” that is, not favored by Heaven."
