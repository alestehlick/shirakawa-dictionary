  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the water radical indicates swelling, rushing water, while the phonetic element 共 provides the sound. Early usage speaks of 洪水, deluges so violent they seemed to rage across the heavens; from this image of water filling to the brim and running rampant, the character extended from the concrete sense of a flood to the broader meanings of greatness and vastness."
