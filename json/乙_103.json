  "explanation": "Shirakawa views 乙 as a pictograph of an animal bone, specifically a bone spatula used in ancient craftwork. In the broader complex of 亂, he evokes a scene where a fine thread (幺/糸) is fastened to a reel (the form kei), with a hand above (爪) and another below (又), showing both hands at work. The bone spatula—乙—is the tool brought in to tease apart the snarl and straighten the thread, a vivid image of bringing order out of tangles. In later usage, 乙 came to serve as the sign for the second of the Ten Heavenly Stems (kinoto)."
