  "explanation": "In its oldest forms, 幸 depicts a pair of hand shackles, a penal device that fastens both wrists. Related characters preserve this image: in 執 (“to seize”), the shackle secures both hands, and in 報 (“to requite”), a kneeling figure is pressed down from behind, with bound hands indicated by 又 (“hand”). Against this backdrop, 幸 came to mean saiwai—good fortune—as in the idea of being spared a harsher penalty: to get off with shackles alone is 僥倖, an unexpected stroke of luck. From that sense of reprieve and relief grew the broader meanings of happiness and blessed good fortune."
