  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 幼 as a pictograph: the element for fine, coiled thread (幺), imagined as a little reel, is shown with something being forced or bent through it, evoking the act of twisting. From this image the original sense was “to twist,” and 幼 served as the original graph of 拗, “to twist, to contort.” The familiar meaning “young” arose later by phonetic loan, borrowing the same sound. Classical usage fixes its scope: the Book of Rites says, “Ten years after birth is called 幼; then one begins to learn,” hence expressions such as 幼学 for the first stage of study around the age of ten."
