  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 辨 as a scene of formal adjudication. The graph sets two 辛—tattooing needles used in oath-taking and penal branding—opposite each other to represent accuser and accused swearing before contest in court. With the knife component, the tool for cutting something into two, the character evokes separating opposing claims. From this composition it comes to mean clarifying both sides and judging a lawsuit, and by extension to divide, investigate, and make clear. Although modern usage often substitutes 弁 for 辨, 瓣, and 辯, 弁 originally depicts a coronet and is a different character."
