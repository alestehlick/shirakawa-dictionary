  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the heart radical signals an inner, emotional state, while 每 (mai/kai) serves as the phonetic and carries imagery. 每 originally depicts a woman with elaborate hair ornaments, evoking a head made heavy and overburdened—a disagreeable, oppressive feeling that shades into “darkness.” That nuance also appears in characters like 海 (sea) and 晦 (dark), which share 每 as their phonetic. Applied to the heart, this gloom becomes the feeling of repentance and regret expressed by 悔. In the compound 悔恨 (kaikon), 恨 uses 艮, a figure of a person retreating before a threatening eye, adding a sense of recoiling disappointment. In Japanese usage, kuyamu can be used in mourning or condolence, while kuyashii conveys a mortified, vexed regret."
