  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees the core of this character in 尉, originally written with the elements 衣 (folded clothing), 火 (fire), and 又 (a hand), depicting someone holding a heated iron to cloth and smoothing it until it becomes soft. As an independent graph, 尉 also functioned as an official title (e.g., 廷尉 in China; in Japan, jō). When 心 (heart) was added beneath this form, it created 慰, shifting the image from softening cloth to softening the heart. Hence nagusameru and nagusamu evoke the gentle easing and relaxation that follow this act of smoothing, now applied to feeling rather than fabric."
