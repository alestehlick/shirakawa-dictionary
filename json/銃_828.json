  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the metal element signals something made of metal, and 充 provides the sound. Shirakawa notes that 充 originally depicted a person with a distended belly, and by extension came to name a round socket-like hole; the Yu Pian glosses it as the hole into which an axe handle is fitted. When firearms were later devised, the character was applied to them, likely by analogy with the circular opening of the muzzle. In usage, 銃 came to denote small firearms, while 砲 referred to heavy pieces."
