  "explanation": "Originally written 溫, this is a phono-semantic character: the phonetic element gives the sound on, while the graphic scene supplies the meaning. It depicts something being heated in a basin-like vessel (ban), the contents visibly stirred and set in motion by rising heat. From this vivid image of warmth coursing through a container, the character came to mean warm, warm/mild in climate, and by extension, when applied to a person’s disposition, gentle and mild. The modern form 温 preserves this sense while simplifying the original graph."
