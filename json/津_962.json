  "explanation": "津 is a phono-semantic character formed with the water radical and the phonetic 聿. In early forms, 聿 depicts piercing the skin with a tattooing needle, with added marks indicating tattoo patterns on the chest and even a vessel set out to catch the blood—an image that highlights a blood-tinged liquid oozing from the wound. From this, 津 originally meant an oozing fluid mixed with blood, a sense still echoed in the term shin'eki (“bodily fluids”). In bronze inscriptions there also appears a different graph, combining 淮 and 舟, connected with bird divination performed to assure the safety of travel by boat; that graph carried the meaning “ferry, port.” Because it shared the same sound, 津 was later borrowed to write “ferry” and “port” as well."
