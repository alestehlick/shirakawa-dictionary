  "explanation": "This character is a compound of 歩 (步) and 頁. In ancient practice, the waterside was a sacred place where deities were welcomed, and 濱 (浜) originally referred to rites carried out at the shore. The component 頁 shows a person in profile with garments and headgear properly arranged for ceremony, so 瀕—and by extension 頻—evokes rites performed at the water’s edge. In bronze inscriptions, the graph written for 順 appears as 瀕, indicating a ceremony honoring one’s parents by the water; the expression 順(瀕)子 referred to a model of filial piety. Viewed together—濱, 順(瀕), and 瀕—these forms attest to festivals and funerary customs observed beside water, including water burial. In later usage, the sense shifted to what happens again and again: “frequent, often.”"
