  "explanation": "In early inscriptions, 婦 appears with the broom graph 帚—a ritual implement of split twigs sprinkled with fragrant wine—used to sweep and purify the ancestral hall. In oracle-bone texts 帚 can even stand for 婦, underscoring their association in sound and function. While 掃 depicts the act of wielding the broom to cleanse and exorcise, 婦 names the woman charged with this sacred work: the wife who, upon entering a new household, becomes part of its lineage and serves its ancestral spirits as the household’s leading woman. Oracle-bone inscriptions record women titled 婦, such as Fu Hao and Fu Jing, commanding armies, suggesting that in the Yin period figures bearing this title could hold significant public roles. In the Zhou period that public aspect waned, though bronze inscriptions still set husband and wife side by side. Divination records also reflect concerns over the spiritual rapport within the family, often asking whether a mother-in-law’s spirit might bring misfortune upon the new wife—evidence of how deeply the role signified by 婦 was tied to ancestral service and ritual purification."
