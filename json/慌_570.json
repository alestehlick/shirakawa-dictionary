  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 慌 as a phono-semantic character: the heart radical signals an inner, emotional state, while 荒 functions as the phonetic, giving the on reading kō. In his view, 荒 originally evoked the disheveled hair of a corpse cast into the weeds, a grim image that came to stand for devastation and famine, as seen in compounds like 荒凶 and in terms for a bad harvest year such as 荒歳 and 荒年. Against that backdrop, 慌 depicts a heart thrown into turmoil by danger directly before one’s eyes—hence the sense of being flurried or panicked, and its role in 恐慌 for widespread panic, including economic upheaval. In classical usage the word also shades into trance-like absorption or vacant confusion, as in 慌忽 and its variant 恍惚 for rapture, and 慌罔 for becoming bewildered and absent-minded."
