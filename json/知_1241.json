  "explanation": "The character combines 矢, an arrow revered as a sacred token of oath-taking, with 口 not as a mouth but as the ritual sai, a vessel that held written prayers offered to the gods. In ancient rites one swore upon the arrow—sometimes even breaking it as a pledge—and placed the covenant text in the vessel. From this image of a solemn vow made before the deities arose the sense of knowing with clarity: to know, to be enlightened. By extension it also came to mean to preside or govern, as in matsurigoto o shiran to su. The older counterpart 智 adds 干, a shield—another sacred implement—further highlighting the ritual context; accordingly, 智 is used for nominal notions like wisdom and knowledge, while 知 expresses the verbal idea of knowing."
