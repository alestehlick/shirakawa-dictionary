  "explanation": "Originally written 歸, the graph joined the sign for sacrificial meat with 帚, the ritual broom sprinkled with wine to purify an ancestral mausoleum; by metonymy, the broom came to signify the mausoleum itself. Later the footstep sign 止 was added to express the act of going back. Before a campaign, meat was offered in the ancestral mausoleum and the military shrine, and the army set out carrying that consecrated meat as a protective presence. On victorious return they reported their safe homecoming to the ancestors in the mausoleum and presented the worship meat—this rite is what 歸/帰 names. From that specific homecoming ceremony the meaning broadened to returning in general, and by the same logic it also came to denote a woman’s marrying into another family, as she announced her new status before the family’s ancestral spirits to be welcomed among them."
