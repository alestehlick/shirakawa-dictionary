  "explanation": "Shirakawa traces this character back to the older form 贊, composed of 兟 and 貝. The graph 兟 depicts two ornamental hairpins set side by side; the hairpin (簪) served as a potent ritual implement in antiquity, even in maledictory rites. When the 貝 element—a shell signifying an offering or valuable—was added, the whole came to picture presenting an offering alongside the hairpin as one petitions the deities for aid. From the gods’ favorable response—their approval and the help that brings matters to fruition—the word took on the senses of assisting, concurring, and, by extension, praising divine virtue. Later, with the addition of the speech element to form 讚, the nuance became explicit verbal praise, standing in a deliberate counterpoise to a related ‘shin’ graph of censure built from 兟 over 日, the vessel for covenant texts."
