  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 教 as a compound centered on 爻, the crossed rafters of a sacred building, joined with 攴, the whip or urging stick. In 斈—the old form that underlies 学—the same rafters shelter 子, the children learning within; 教 replaces the child with the urging hand/rod to show an elder driving on the learners under those sacred eaves. The crossed-wood roof motif survives in Shinto architecture as a mark of sanctity, and in antiquity noble youths gathered in such sanctuaries to receive training in tradition and ceremony from senior elders. From this ritualized scene of instruction comes the meaning “to teach.”"
