  "explanation": "Originally written as 樂, this is a pictograph of a handbell with a handle. The central “white” element represents the bell itself, while the paired yō components on the left and right render the tasselled cords that adorn it. Such a bell was shaken in court dances and music to delight the gods, and a shamaness would also ring it in healing rites to drive away the spirit of illness. In that ritual context the graph for ryō came to be associated with curing, and the character 療 was later created on that basis as a phono-semantic formation. From this sacred instrument, the senses broadened: for ‘music’ it is read gaku, for ‘to enjoy, ease’ it is read raku, and for ‘to like’ it is read gō."
