  "explanation": "In the earliest forms, 周 is a compound: a rectangular shield whose face is quartered by a cross, each section bearing carved patterns that served as the Zhou clan’s crest, joined with sai, the covenant casket into which written prayers to the gods were placed. The image evokes a Zhou ritual—reciting petitions and praying for victory with emblazoned shields—and from this ritual setting the graph became the name of the Zhou house that succeeded the Yin in the 11th century BCE. By early graphic and phonetic interchange with the similarly read 舟 “boat” and related travel graphs, the character also came to express the ideas of circling and breadth. Hence its later senses of periphery and circuit, and by extension ‘all around,’ reflected in the readings mawari, meguru, and amaneshi."
