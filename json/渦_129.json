  "explanation": "Shirakawa takes 渦 as a phono-semantic character: the water element shows it concerns water, while the phonetic 咼 (ka) goes back to a form that combines a ritual covenant receptacle—where written petitions to the gods were placed—with the round, hollow bones of the upper torso (冎). This image carries the sense of praying for purification from misfortune, and the rounded, cavity-like skull evokes a spiraling pattern. Set beside water, that spiral becomes water that coils and turns, hence the meanings of whirlpool and eddy, seen in the readings uzu and uzumaku."
