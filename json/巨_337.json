  "explanation": "This character began as a pictograph of a carpenter’s square, a right-angled ruler. The slight swelling depicted at its center marks the handgrip; in some bronze inscriptions a human figure (written as 大) is even added to show someone grasping it. In contrast to 規, the compass used to draw circles, the square (矩) draws straight lines and right angles, and together 規矩 came to signify standards or rules. Later, 巨 was borrowed to write 鉅, so it also took on the sense of “big, huge.”"
