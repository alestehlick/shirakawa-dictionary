  "explanation": "Originally written 對, the character combines a toothed earth-rammer—an implement with saw-like teeth—held in the hand (寸) and used upon earth (土). In this form it first denoted the act of beating or tamping. In rammed-earth construction (hanchiku), two workers stand on opposing sides, pounding the fill toward each other to compact it; from that scene arose the senses “to face,” “to meet,” and by extension “to respond” or “answer in return.” The streamlined form 対 preserves this core image of opposing sides brought into firm contact."
