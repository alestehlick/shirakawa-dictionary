  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph, 律 takes its On reading from 聿 (itsu), the picture of a brush held in the hand (又). In early practice, setting down the brush was how positions and arrangements were fixed—like laying out the plan of a building—and by extension how matters were authoritatively made public. From this notion of uniformly setting and proclaiming standards, the character came to signify law, rules, and established regulations."
