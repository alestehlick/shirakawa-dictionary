  "explanation": "Originally written 價, this is a phono-semantic character built on 賈 as its phonetic. Because 賈 denotes trade—buying and selling—it supplies both the sound ka and the commercial sense, and the simplified form 価 carries this forward. Thus 価 expresses the value or price of things, their worth (as in 価値), and by extension appears in words for appraisal and evaluation (評価), the act of determining that value."
