  "explanation": "嗣 portrays the formal act of succession as a sacred rite. It combines 司, “to preside at divine ceremonies,” with 冊, the barred door of a pen for sacrificial animals—added because offerings accompanied investiture in antiquity. Bronze inscriptions show forms where 冊 and 司 are paired; later, 口 was added—not a mere mouth, but sai, the receptacle that held written prayers to the gods, evoking the chanting of petitions and the authority to conduct the ceremony. From this ritual setting, the character came to mean inheriting a rank or position, succeeding to a line, and thus an heir or successor."
