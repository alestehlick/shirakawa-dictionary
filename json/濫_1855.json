  "explanation": "濫 is a phono-semantic character: the water element signals a relation to spreading water, while 監 serves as the phonetic, marking the on-reading ran, as also seen in 覧 and 藍. The ancient Shuowen glosses it as “to float, to spread,” evoking water that overflows and fans out—hence the sense of inundation in 氾濫. From this image developed its broader uses: to overflow or run rampant, and by extension to act without proper restraint or warrant—an indiscriminate, excessive manner captured in compounds such as 濫獲 and 濫用."
