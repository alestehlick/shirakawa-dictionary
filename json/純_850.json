  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 純 as a phono-semantic compound: the silk radical 糸 points to textiles, while the phonetic 屯 originally depicted a tassel where the threads of a cloth are gathered and tied off at the edge. From this image of threads stopping and being fastened at the border came the notion of a decorated hem or border ornament. Bronze inscriptions record gifts described with 屯 in this sense—such as black garments adorned with edge tassels and ceremonial robes with embroidered borders—and even use 屯 with the value of “pure, genuine.” Building on this textile image of threads gathered without admixture, 純 came to mean “pure, unmixed, genuine,” and later extended toward senses of completeness or exclusivity, while 屯 itself shifted in use toward “to gather.”"
