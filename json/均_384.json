  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the soil element 土 points to leveling ground, while the phonetic 勻 (giving the On reading kin) originally depicted equal-weight cakes of copper cast in a mold. From that image of things made to the same weight arises the sense of being equal or alike; with 土 added, the character focuses on flattening uneven earth and, by extension, on equalizing and making things uniform."
