  "explanation": "Originally written as 鷄, this is a phono-semantic graph: 奚 serves as the phonetic, signaling the on reading kei and echoing the bird’s cry. The Shuowen designates 雞 as the orthodox form, treating it as the Zhou-style counterpart of 鷄. Oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions already depict a rooster with comb and sweeping tail, a silhouette reminiscent of the august phoenix 鳳, suggesting the cock was once regarded as a sacred bird. When a bird belonged to mythic, sacred lore, scribes drew its full outline; for an ordinary bird they reduced it to the short‑tailed bird form. Thus the character fuses sound and image: like the 九 in 鳩 that also writes a call, 鷄/鶏 captures the rooster’s voice—much as old Japanese kake and English cock echo the same cry."
