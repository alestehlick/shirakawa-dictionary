  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 窮 as a compound of 穴, a hole or cave, and 躬, the body bent over. It pictures a person pressing their body into a cramped cavity, movement restricted and freedom pinched. From this image come senses of being straitened or driven to the limit—hence “to be at a loss” or “in extremity.” Because the body must bend to reach the innermost recess, the graph also came to express probing to the utmost, the act of pursuing something to its end—“to investigate thoroughly” and “to master.” The bent-body element is close in sound and sense to 究 “to exhaust,” and the notion of the “ultimate” preserves the idea of reaching the furthest point. By extension, it can depict the distress and suffering of a life pressed into narrow circumstances."
