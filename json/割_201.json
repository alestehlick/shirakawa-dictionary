  "explanation": "割 is a phono-semantic compound. 害 provides the sound and conjures a ritual image: a covenant vessel (sai), into which written prayers to the gods are placed, is pierced with a large handled pin, an act that ruins the efficacy of those petitions—spoiling them. With the addition of the knife element 刂, that destructive act is emphasized as cutting, so the character comes to mean to part and sever—divide, split, and break—and, by extension, to spoil."
