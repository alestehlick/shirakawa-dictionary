  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the walking radical suggests movement and travel, while the phonetic element 軍 supplies the sound un and recalls its old form—a war flag streaming from a chariot. The general’s flag directed maneuvers; the army wheeled its chariots and shifted position in response. From this scene come the senses of turning and circulating, setting things in motion, and thus carrying and conveying. The on reading un is also heard in 暈, the halo that rings the sun or moon, subtly echoing the idea of encircling movement."
