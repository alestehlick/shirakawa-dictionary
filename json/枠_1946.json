  "explanation": "A Japanese-made character, 枠 takes the wood element to show material and structure, and borrows its sound from a Chinese graph that named a device for winding thread on a reel—a rotating spindle set within a wooden frame. From this image it came to mean a wooden frame assembled in a square or rectangular form, hence everyday uses such as the window frame (madowaku). The reading waku was adopted directly."
