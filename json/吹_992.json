  "explanation": "This character is a compound showing breath directed toward a ritual object. It combines 欠, the side view of a person with mouth open—signifying exhaling, speaking, singing, or calling—with a vessel that held covenant texts and petitions to the gods. In early forms, the figure is kneeling and blowing toward that receptacle, suggesting a counter-charm that blows upon the prayer to dispel or nullify its effect. From this vivid scene the sense developed into “to blow on,” “to blow,” and, by extension, blowing into wind instruments."
