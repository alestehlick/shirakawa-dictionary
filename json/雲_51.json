  "explanation": "雲 is a phono-semantic character: the semantic is the rain radical 雨, and the phonetic is 云 (un). In archaic forms, 云 depicts the faintly coiled tail of a dragon glimpsed beneath drifting vapors, a vivid image that conveyed the idea of “cloud.” Over time, the rain element was added to yield the modern graph 雲. Because clouds gather and blur into indistinguishable masses, the character also came to suggest a state of accumulation or confusion, a nuance reflected in derivatives such as 紜 (un), describing tangled threads, and 耘 (un), “to till,” breaking soil into fine, many pieces. Meanwhile, 云 itself diverged in usage to mean “to say,” as in 云う (iu)."
