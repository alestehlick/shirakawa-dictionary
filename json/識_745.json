  "explanation": "In its original form 識 combines the speech element with a right-hand component depicting a halberd adorned with an attached emblem—a decorated weapon used as a standard or marker. That ornament was likely red silk, a nuance that links this component to related graphs such as 熾, evoking blazing brilliance, and 幟, a banner fixed to a pole. The right element thus both provides the sound and conjures the idea of a conspicuous sign. From the notion that one can distinguish and identify things by such a mark, the character’s meaning extends from “sign; to mark” to “to know, to recognize,” and by further development to “knowledge” (知識) and “discernment, sound judgment” (見識)."
