  "explanation": "拓 is a phono-semantic character: the hand radical indicates action, while 石 serves as the phonetic, a role it also plays in characters such as 宕 and 妬. In the Shuowen it is glossed as “to pick up,” and an old variant form 摭, which uses 庶 as its phonetic, points in the same direction. 庶 originally depicts a kitchen scene with a pot, evoking the act of lifting food out—an image that underlies related graphs like 蹠. From this core sense of picking up, the meaning broadened to opening up and developing land, as seen in compounds like 拓殖, 拓植, 拓地, and 開拓; it later extended to the act of rubbing or pounding to take an impression, as in 拓本, a paper rubbing made from inscriptions carved in stone."
