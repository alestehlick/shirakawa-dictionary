  "explanation": "辱 is a compound of 辰 and 寸. In early forms, 辰 depicts a mobile shell—like a clam—whose emptied shell was fixed to the end of a stick to make an implement; with the hand mark 寸, the character shows that shell-tool held in the hand. From this image arose the original sense of cutting and eradicating weeds with a Venus-shell implement (shinki). This older meaning is preserved in 耨, which combines the plough radical 耒 with 辱 to mean “to weed.” Later, the character came to express “to humiliate” and the feeling of shame, likely through association with a graph meaning “to feel ashamed.” From the notion of feeling abashed before someone worthy of reverence developed the polite sense katajikenai, an expression of humbled, grateful deference toward a superior."
