  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 妊 as a phono-semantic compound: the woman radical 女 provides the field of meaning, while 壬 functions as the phonetic. 壬 originally depicts a forging stand with a thick, bulging center; that swelling profile is carried over to evoke the rounding of a woman’s abdomen, giving 妊 the sense “to conceive, to be pregnant.” In contrast, 娠 conveys the child’s movement within, likened to the stirring of a clam, and together the compound 妊娠 names the state of pregnancy. This accords with the Shuowen gloss “to become pregnant.” Related pictographs that express the same idea include 身, showing a side view of a person with a distended belly, and 孕, which writes an embryo set within the belly of a standing figure."
