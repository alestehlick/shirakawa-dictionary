  "explanation": "In bronze inscriptions, 往 is a picto‑phonetic graph: on the left is 彳, the sign of walking, and on the right a component formed by placing the footprint sign 之 atop 王, the head of the ceremonial broadax that symbolized royal authority. Before departing on the king’s command, one would ritually set one’s feet upon this sacred axe to take on its numinous power; accordingly that right-hand element itself conveyed “to go” and also served as the phonetic. Combined with 彳, it yields the meaning “to go, to set out.” This idea of going was later extended to time, giving the sense “the past.”"
