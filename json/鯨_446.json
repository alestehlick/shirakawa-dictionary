  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the fish radical (魚) signals an aquatic creature, while 京 serves as the phonetic, giving the on-reading gei and suggesting grandeur. Early dictionaries gloss it as “a great fish of the sea,” and the Yu Pian calls it “the king of fish,” that is, the whale. The image resonated in poetry—Du Fu writes of drinking “like a great whale drawing in a hundred rivers.” In traditional usage 鯨 could denote the male whale, with 鯢 for the female; together they appear as 鯨鯢."
