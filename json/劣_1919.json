  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 劣 as a compound of 少 (few) and 力, which in ancient script depicts a plow. The graph pictures meager muscular strength at the plow—insufficient power for tilling—hence the idea of weakness and inferiority, a sense already noted as \"weak\" in the Shuowen. From this concrete scene the meaning broadened to \"to be inferior,\" \"weak,\" and by extension \"few.\""
