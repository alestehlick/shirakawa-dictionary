  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 坊 takes 方 as its phonetic, which also evokes the notion of dividing space into squares. Inside walled cities, streets were laid out in a jōri grid of square sections, and each section was a 坊 with its own “block name” (坊名). From this base sense it came to mean a ward or town and, by extension, a place of commerce, as seen in compounds like 坊市 (market town), 坊肆 (shop), and 酒坊 (liquor shop). Temple precincts were similarly partitioned into 坊, so the character can also refer to a temple and, more specifically, to monastic living quarters (坊舎, 僧坊) and their head (坊主)."
