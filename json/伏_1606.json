  "explanation": "This character combines a person with a dog and originally points to the ritual called fukuei (伏瘞), the interment of a person together with a dog beneath the coffin in the grave chamber to quell malign forces thought to lurk in the earth; 瘞 denotes burial in the ground. Archaeological finds from the Yin (Shang) period include royal burials where armed retainers and dogs were placed below the coffin, and in the Qin period there were 伏祠, shrines for dog rites intended to ward off the calamity of gu (worm sorcery) through canine sacrifice. From the core sense of pressing or burying into the earth, the meaning broadened to “hide, conceal,” and by extension “turn face down” and “lie prostrate.” It also came to serve in place of 服 with the sense “to yield or submit,” as seen in kofuku (降伏/降服), “surrender.”"
