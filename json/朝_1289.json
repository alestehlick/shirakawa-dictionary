  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 朝 as a vivid image of dawn: the graph combines grass (艸) and the sun (日), with blades of grass drawn above and below the sun, while the moon (月) still lingers—together evoking daybreak. In bronze inscriptions the lower element appears as water (水) instead of the moon, suggesting the rising tide of morning. In the Yin (Shang) period, a sunrise rite was held at daybreak, and important state decisions were conducted then, so the character naturally extended to mean the court and affairs of government, as seen in compounds like 朝政, 朝見, 朝廷, and 朝野."
