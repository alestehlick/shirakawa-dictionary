  "explanation": "In its earliest form, 尽 combines 聿—an image of a hand gripping a slender bough-like rod—with a dish and drops of water, depicting a thin stick being scrubbed in a basin. The scene conveys washing something thoroughly until nothing remains. From this vivid act of exhaustive cleansing, the character came to mean driving a thing to its limit: to exhaust or use up, to run short and come to an end, and by extension, to do something to the utmost and to denote “entirely” or “all.”"
