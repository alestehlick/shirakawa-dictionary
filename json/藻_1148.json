  "explanation": "藻 is a phono-semantic character: the grass radical marks it as a plant. Its phonetic element is given as 果, while the Shuowen cites 巢; both portray things massed on a tree—either many small receptacles for prayer writings hung up and offered with clamor, or the heads of nestlings aligned in a tree nest—so they carry the sense of “many” gathered together. From this image of dense covering, the character came to name mo, the water plants that spread across a water’s surface. Admiring the beauty of those patterns, it further came to mean decorative design and elegant rhetorical ornament, as seen in words like 藻麗 and 文藻."
