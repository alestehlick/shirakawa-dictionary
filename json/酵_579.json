  "explanation": "酵 is a phono-semantic character: the 酉 element signals wine and brewing, while 孝 (read kou) provides the sound. The Yupian already defines it as the ferment for liquor—the koji-like starter that sets the mash in motion. It refers to the matured, bubbling mash that, once strained, becomes wine. In early China the making and sale of liquor were under state control, and brewing from fermented rice gruel was prohibited, a severity that underscores how central this ferment was to alcohol production."
