  "explanation": "This character combines the grass radical with 廌, the sacred judicial beast (kaitai) akin to a sheep, associated with divine ordeals. Bronze inscriptions even show grass placed both above and below, evoking a spread of vegetation on which the sacrificial kaitai is laid and presented to the gods. From this ritual scene, the sense naturally developed into “to present, to offer,” and by extension “to recommend.” In ritual terminology such as the Zhou Rites, the binome 薦羞 distinguishes offerings: 薦 denotes the uncooked, while 羞 refers to the cooked. The character later also came to be used for the idea of doing something “frequently, repeatedly.”"
