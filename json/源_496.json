  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the water radical signals meaning, while 原 provides the sound gen and evokes an older form depicting water flowing between cliffs—the very image of a spring. Over time, 原 was borrowed to write hara, an open plain, so the water element was added to preserve the older sense, yielding 源 for a water source. Early inscriptions already reflect this division, with 原 used for an even plain and 源 for a spring. From the concrete image of a wellspring, the character naturally extended to the abstract ideas of beginning and basis—the source of things in general."
