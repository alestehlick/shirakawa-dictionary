  "explanation": "項 is a phono-semantic character combining the head element 頁 with the phonetic 工. 工 originally depicts a craftsman’s tool or block used as a firm base; here it contributes the sound kou and the image of solid support. Set beside the head, the graph points to the part that supports it from behind—the nape, the back of the neck. By contrast, 頸 (kei), whose phonetic depicts warp threads drawn taut in a loom, names the throat and neck with their visible arteries, while 項 specifies the back of that region. The same nape sense underlies 領 (ryo) ‘nape, collar’. From the act of lowering the head to show assent comes the expression 強項 ‘strong nape’ for refusal to yield—famously the epithet 強項侯, ‘Marquis Strong Nape,’ bestowed on Dong Xuan of the Later Han for defying Emperor Guangwu. By extension, 項 also came to mean a clause or heading in an itemized classification (as in 項目)."
