  "explanation": "廃 is a phono-semantic character, originally written 廢, with 発 as its phonetic element—発 evoking the loosing of the first arrow that opens a campaign. In earlier usage, the sense ‘to stop, abolish; to throw away’ was written with 灋, the older form of 法. Bronze inscriptions even record the injunction 勿灋朕命, “Do not cast away my command.” The graph 灋 depicts throwing into water the person (大) who has failed a divine ordeal, together with the covenant vessel whose lid has been removed (凵) and the sacred beast 廌; from this imagery arose the meaning “to throw away.” From 灋 later developed 法 (with the beast element abbreviated) in the sense of “law, rule,” while 廃, built with the roof-like element 广 suggesting a building and the phonetic 発, came to mean “to cease, to fall out of use, to discard,” originally evoking the disposal of a structure judged no longer useful."
