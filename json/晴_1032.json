  "explanation": "晴 is a phono-semantic character formed with the sun element 日 and 青. Here 青 functions as the phonetic, giving the On reading sei, and it also carries the sense of “to become completely clear.” Joined to the sun, it expresses the sky clearing and fine weather. The Shuowen captures this image: rain falls, then by evening it clears and the stars come out. A form written with 目, 睛, is recorded in some sources, but no ancient examples are known; it seems to be a Shuowen-only variant, while the original graph is 晴."
