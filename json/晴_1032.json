  "explanation": "晴 is a phono-semantic compound written with the sun (日) and 青. Here 青 serves both as the phonetic that yields the On reading sei and as a bearer of sense: it denotes a state of becoming completely clear. Accordingly, 晴 came to mean to clear up and, by extension, fair or sunny weather. The Shuowen evokes the image of rain easing at dusk so that the sky opens and stars appear, a vision of the starry heavens that beautifully captures the idea of a sky swept clean. The form 睛 is a lexicographic variant without early attested use."
