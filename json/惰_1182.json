  "explanation": "A phonetic-semantic character: the left side is the heart radical, indicating a state of mind or feeling. The right side is 隋, which here supplies the sound da and evokes a ritual scene. Shirakawa explains 隋 as built from 自, the divine ladder for ascent and descent, 左, a hand grasping the ritual implement 工, and 月, meat—together picturing sacrificial meat heaped before the god’s ladder. Associated with the earth element (as in the related form 堕, “to crumble, fall”), this imagery suggests offerings slumping down. Applied to the heart, it depicts a heart that has lost its firmness or shape, hence the senses of growing slack: laziness, idleness, and neglect."
