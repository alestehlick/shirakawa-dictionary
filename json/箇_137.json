  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the bamboo radical points to the original material, while 固 serves as the phonetic element that marks the Sino-Japanese reading. The Shuowen explains it as naming a piece of bamboo, something like a bamboo spatula; because such pieces were set out in rows when tallying, the graph came to signify a counting unit and was used for enumerating items (as in “one item,” “two items”). In later usage it appears in abbreviated counter forms such as 个 and 介: 一介 was used specifically for counting persons, whereas 個—formed with the person radical—came to be used exclusively for counting things."
