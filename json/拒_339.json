  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the phonetic is 巨, originally the form of a carpenter’s square (sashigane), a tool that juts out on one side and thus does not sit flush with other things. From this image of not fitting—of standing apart—comes the sense of refusing or keeping something at bay. With the hand classifier added, the character takes on the concrete action of the hand: to hold off, keep away, and refuse, while 巨 also supplies the on reading kyo."
