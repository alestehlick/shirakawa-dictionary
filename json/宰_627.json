  "explanation": "宰 combines the roof sign 宀, the shrine where ancestral souls are venerated, with 辛, a heavy-handled butchering knife used to cut up sacrificial meat. In its early forms it points to the elder entrusted with carving the offering and presenting it to the ancestors within the shrine. From this role of supervising the rite, the character came to mean one who presides and manages affairs; in China it further designated high political office, as in 宰相, the minister assisting the emperor, comparable to a prime minister."
