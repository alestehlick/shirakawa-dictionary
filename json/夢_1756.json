  "explanation": "This character is a compound of 莧 and 夕. 莧 depicts a seated female shaman with heavily drawn eyebrows; in related forms she appears praying within the ancestral mausoleum. With 夕 marking the night, the graph presents dreams as nocturnal visitations brought forth through the workings of a spirit under a shaman’s ritual agency. Hence 夢 means both “dream” and “to dream.” Ancient institutions even appointed specialists in dream divination (占夢), and at year’s end a rite called 堂贈 was performed to review and send off the year’s dreams, exorcising ill-omened ones. The term 菀, used for the death of nobles, was understood as death caused by a dream demon (夢魔), showing how seriously nightmares were regarded."
