  "explanation": "練 is a phono-semantic character: the left side 糸 signals thread, while the right side 柬 serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on-reading ren. Shirakawa explains 柬 as the image of a sack (橐) with something inside, evoking a process of manufacture or treatment. Early lexica gloss the word’s core as the finishing of silk: the Shuowen defines it as “glossed silk,” and the Yupian describes boiling and rinsing—heat and washing that soften and finish threads. From this concrete sense of treating silk until it is smooth and lustrous, the character naturally broadened to the figurative idea of polishing ability—hence ‘to train’ and ‘to practice,’ as seen in words like 練習 and 練磨, and in the related form 煉, which shares the same phonetic and notion of refinement through processing."
