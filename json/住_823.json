  "explanation": "Shirakawa views 住 as a picto-phonetic graph centered on 主, which here serves as the sound element and depicts a lamplight: the dot marks the heart of the flame, with the tallow tray and its pedestal beneath. The lamplight’s upright stand evokes a pillar, and from the image of pillars set in line comes the sense of a house frame—a place where people live. Thus the character means sumu, to live, and sumau, to continue living, and by extension also carries the idea of remaining or staying, as reflected in words like 住居, a dwelling where one stays for a long time."
