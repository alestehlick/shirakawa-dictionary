  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character formed with the clothing radical and 甫 as the phonetic, 補 takes its sound from 甫 (ho). Shirakawa explains 甫 as the figure of a young plant showing its roots, carrying the idea of enclosing or wrapping. Set beside the clothing element, the character originally pictured wrapping a frayed spot of cloth to mend it—hence the sense seen in hoshuu, “mending,” and the broader meanings “to supplement,” “to repair,” and “to make up for,” extending naturally to “to help.” In the same phonetic series, 輔 (ho) names the braces fixed alongside a vehicle’s frame—the splints that assist the wheel—further illustrating the shared notion of supporting and aiding."
