  "explanation": "迷 is a phono-semantic character: the movement element 辶 evokes going or wandering, while 米 acts as the phonetic, giving the reading mei. Early lexica gloss it as to be perplexed, disordered, or confused, and the Book of Odes (Jie Nan Shan) uses it in the phrase “to keep the people from going astray,” showing that since antiquity it has expressed the idea of losing one’s way, whether in path or in mind."
