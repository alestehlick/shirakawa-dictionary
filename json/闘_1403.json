  "explanation": "This is a phono-semantic character. In early writing it appears as 鬪, and the proper, fully written form is 鬬. The core element 鬥 depicts two people grappling—hands clutching and hair disheveled—conveying the sense of “to contend, to fight.” A phonetic element indicates the on reading tou; in related analysis, 斷 is explained as combining an engraved shield 盾 with a battle-axe 斤, imagery that further evokes combat. Taken together, the character means “to fight.” For comparison, 戦 (戰) expresses the same idea with a different makeup: 單, an oval shield adorned with two feathers, set alongside the pike 戈."
