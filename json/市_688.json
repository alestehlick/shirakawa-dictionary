  "explanation": "This character began as a simple pictograph: a conspicuous sign set up to mark where the market was held. Because markets drew crowds, a tall marker was erected and a steward oversaw the space beneath it. Some early variants added a small element like 止 above, taken as a cue for the sound shi, but since that addition did not survive in the received form, 市 is best understood as the bare signboard itself. From this origin it came to denote the market and the buying and selling that took place there, and by extension a town or city defined by having such a market. In antiquity, the 市 was also a lively social venue—site of festive song gatherings (utagaki) where young men and women met to sing, feast, dance, and freely mingle."
