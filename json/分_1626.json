  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 分 as a compound of 八 and 刀. The graph 八 shows something split into left and right, while 刀 is the blade that performs the cut. Together they depict dividing an object into two, which underlies the senses “to divide,” “to separate,” and “to branch off” seen in wakeru, wakatsu, and wakareru. Classical glosses simply define it as “to separate.” The related character 別 originally evokes cutting at the joints with a knife, and from this combination comes the idea of 分別—discriminating by kind. In Japanese the meaning naturally extends to wakaru, “to understand,” since understanding is the ability to make clear distinctions, as in the phrase “a person who understands reason.”"
