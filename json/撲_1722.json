  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 撲 as a phono-semantic graph. Its phonetic is the form he identifies as 業, depicting a tool with saw-like teeth grasped in both hands—an image that conveys the actions of striking and knocking something down. With the hand radical added, the character takes on the concrete sense of beating. In bronze inscriptions a related form is read haku, and expressions such as hakubatsu evoke the notion of subjugation by force. The same phonetic element appears in 僕 and 樸, which share the on-reading boku, showing how these graphs are linked in both sound and the core idea of forcefully bringing something down."
