  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 改 as a compound of 巳 and 攴. In early forms, 巳 does not mean “self,” but represents a gu vessel packed with noxious creatures and shaped like coiled snakes, an instrument used in cursing rituals. When paired with 攴, the hand that strikes, the graph depicts a rite of beating the vessel to drive off and divert the misfortune trying to cling to one’s person. From this exorcistic act of altering one’s lot, 改 came to mean to reform, renew, and improve. Later script traditions sometimes treated it as a phono-semantic graph, but the archaic forms preserve its origin in a ritual of purification and change."
