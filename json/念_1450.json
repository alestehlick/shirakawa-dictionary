  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 念 as a phono‑semantic compound. The upper element 今, serving as the phonetic, originally depicts a lid fitted with a stopper—the closure of a jar or bottle—and related ancient forms even show a wine vessel (酉) sealed in this way. Beneath it sits 心, the heart. Together they picture something shut under a lid within the heart—feelings and ideas kept inside—and from this image the character comes to mean to harbor a thought, to think, and the heart or mind."
