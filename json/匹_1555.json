  "explanation": "This graph is pictographic: its paired strokes sketch the chest of horses standing in a row. It first denoted horses as counted animals, and bronze inscriptions use it in grant formulas such as “to bestow a horse” and “to bestow four horses.” From the image of lined-up horses arose senses of pairing and matching—one’s mate or consort, things set in line or of the same kind—hence uses seen in words like 匹偶 (mate), 匹配 (to match, to line up), and the idea of being an equal, as in 匹敵 (to be a match for)."
