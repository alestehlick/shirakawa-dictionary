  "explanation": "A late phono-semantic compound, 搬 sets the hand element beside 般, which supplies the sound han. The graph 般 is itself the original form of 盤 and evokes a tray or bowl, so the whole character pictures hands bearing a vessel with something in it. From this image arise the senses “to carry” and, by extension, “to move, transfer.” Because 搬 is a relatively new coinage, it does not appear in ancient dictionaries; earlier texts simply used 般 for this meaning. The distinct form 搬 came into regular use from the Yuan and Ming periods onward."
