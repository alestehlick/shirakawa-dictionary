  "explanation": "In its original form 戲, the graph combines 盧 and 戈 to picture a performer wrapped in a tiger hide, seated on a high-footed 豆-like bench, while a halberd is brought down from behind. This scene evokes a ritual court dance that imitated a martial deity and was performed as a prayer for victory. From that setting the character came to designate military formations—the left and right wings of the army—and even simply “to fight.” As the victory-pleading pageant came to be seen as theatrical posturing, the word naturally shifted to meanings such as play, sport, jesting, and teasing."
