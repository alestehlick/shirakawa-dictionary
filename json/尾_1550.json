  "explanation": "An ancient pictograph of an animal with its tail stretched straight out. In the script tradition, when the tail is shown bent and the body crouched, the form becomes 屈; in 屬/属, a graph depicting animals coupling, 尾 marks the female with her tail raised. From the concrete image of an animal’s tail the character naturally broadened to mean the trailing edge or last part—hence the senses of hem, rear, and end."
