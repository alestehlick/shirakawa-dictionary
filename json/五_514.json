  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 五 as the image of a double wooden lid, two planks crossed diagonally to seal a sacred receptacle. Its use as the numeral “five” is a loan based on the on reading go, whereas the characters for one through four arose directly from tally rods set side by side. The same “double lid” form also appears in 吾, where it is placed atop a covenant vessel that held written prayers; sealing the lid preserves their power, giving rise to notions of protecting and warding off. As a numeral, 五 is widely used as a name-number in expressions such as 五行, the five circulating agents, and 五倫, the five human relations."
