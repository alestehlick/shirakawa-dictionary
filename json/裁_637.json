  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the phonetic element 戋 signals the on reading sai, while the graph evokes a consecrated pike 戈 bearing a sacred marker 標—an emblem used in rites of exorcism and purification that inaugurate undertakings. Set over the clothing element, this points to the inaugural act of tailoring: making the very first cut in cloth in order to prepare a garment. From that decisive “first cut,” the sense broadens to arranging and managing affairs, making determinations, and passing judgment, which underlies its use in words for deciding and adjudicating."
