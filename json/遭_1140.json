  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character. The semantic element 辵 (辶) marks movement along a road. The phonetic 曹 (so), in its early form, depicts two people—the accuser and the accused—placing bundles of arrows into a bag-like vessel (東 used as the form of 橐, “bag”) as a solemn oath before the gods to initiate a trial. With the road radical added, the graph came to picture two people coming together on the way, giving the sense “to encounter, to run into unexpectedly,” as seen in compounds like遭遇."
