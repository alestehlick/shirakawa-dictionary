  "explanation": "床 is a phono-semantic character whose original form was 牀, a drawing of a wooden bedstead. In that older graph, 爿 provides the sound (shō) and, even though it was not used independently with the meaning “bed,” it itself sketches the frame of a bed. The later form 床 came into general use and, although the Yu Pian labeled it a vulgar variant of 牀, it is well attested from the Tang period. A Tang-era anecdote in the Shi Tong speaks of “setting a bed upon a bed,” like building a house atop a house, to exemplify pointless effort. While the basic meaning is “bed,” in Japanese the word extends naturally to the floor and to the decorative alcove of a reception room, seen in uses such as tokonoma, tokoyama, and yukaue."
