  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 謹 as a phono-semantic graph: 言, “speech,” joined with 堇, which gives the on-reading kin and conjures an ancient ritual scene. 堇 depicts, in times of crop failure, a shaman bearing a sai—a covenant vessel for written prayers—set upon the head, the hands crossed and bound, offered in a desperate rite to invoke rain. With 言 added, the character marks the solemn words of supplication voiced in that moment, speech measured to appease divine anger. From this core, 謹 comes to mean conducting oneself and one’s words with careful restraint, humility, and respectful deference."
