  "explanation": "Originally written 應, this is a phono‑semantic character. Its key element, identified here as 雁 (serving as the on‑reading indicator for ō), depicts a person pressing a bird (隹, specifically a hawk) to the breast (膺), an image of hawk‑hunting. In Japan this solemn hunt, called ukeigari, was performed as a form of divination to question the gods; the outcome was received as a revelation. From that ritual setting grew the sense of “respond,” understood first as the deity’s answer to inquiry. Because the component supplies both sound and this ritual‑semantic associations, the character is an example of 亦声, where a phonetic also carries meaning."
