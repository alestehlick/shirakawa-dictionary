  "explanation": "Originally written 淺, this is a phono-semantic character: the water element adds the sense of water, while 戔 serves as the phonetic, yielding the On reading sen. 戔 depicts long, narrow pikes (戈) stacked up, suggesting a state of things being thin and scant. With water added, the primary sense is water that is shallow, which then broadened to shallow in general, as well as thin or slight and few or little. Applied to people, it further came to describe a superficial, thoughtless, or foolish disposition."
