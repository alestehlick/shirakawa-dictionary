  "explanation": "In its earliest form, this graph depicted an amputated bone; when the knife element 刀 is added, it yields 切, “to cut.” Its value as the numeral seven is a phonetic loan based on the sound. In ancient China, odd numbers were revered, and along with three and five, seven was regarded as sacred. Hence literary expressions such as 七発 and 七啓 do not enumerate books or chapters, but invoke the spell-like, consoling power of repeated recitation under the sign of seven."
