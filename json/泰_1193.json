  "explanation": "A compound graph that combines 大, 収, and 水. 大 depicts a person seen from the front with arms and legs outstretched; 収 shows the left and right hands aligned; 水 is water. Together they portray using both hands to lift someone who has fallen into the water, and from this life-saving image the character comes to mean calm, safe, and tranquil. By extension it also conveys abundance, largeness, and intensification (“very”). The character 太 results from reducing the water element in 泰 to a single dot and can be viewed as an abbreviated form; 泰, 太, and 大 are at times used in one another’s stead. Culturally, 泰 appears in 泰山 (Mount Tai), famed as the site of the imperial Feng and Shan rites, and in the expression 泰山北斗 (abbreviated 泰斗), honoring a person revered as the preeminent guiding authority in a field."
