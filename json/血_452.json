  "explanation": "In the earliest script forms, 血 shows blood presented in a ritual dish: a vessel like a plate below and a drop above, which is why the character came to mean both “blood” itself and, by extension, the act of consecrating by blood—“to smear with blood.” The Shuowen defines it as the sacrificial blood offered at festivals; in ancient rites the blood of oxen and sheep was a vital offering to the gods, and newly finished ritual vessels and bells were purified by being painted with blood. Mencius preserves this custom in the story of King Xuan of Qi, who, seeing a trembling ox being led to have its blood smeared on a newly cast bell, spared the ox and ordered a sheep used instead. The oracle-bone and bronze forms capture this ritual setting, anchoring the character’s sense in sacred offering and consecration."
