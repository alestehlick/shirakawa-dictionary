  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the right-side element 窄, read saku, provides the sound and evokes the act of narrowing a hole by thrusting a bent twig—represented by 乍—into it. With the hand radical 扌 added, the graph depicts forcing a small branch into an opening by hand and compressing it, an image of applying pressure to squeeze or wring. From this concrete action, 搾 came to mean shiboru, to squeeze or wring, and it is a relatively late formation not recorded in the oldest dictionaries."
