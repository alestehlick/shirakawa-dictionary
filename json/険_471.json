  "explanation": "Originally written 險, this is a phono-semantic graph. The left element 阜, the ‘gods’ ladder,’ depicts a stepped height by which deities descend and ascend, evoking a lofty, precipitous sacred place. The right element 僉 supplies the sound (as in 儉/倹 and 驗, all read ken) and was once drawn as two people side by side, united in vow, presenting covenant vessels that held written prayers. In early usage, 險 referred to a protective prayer rite performed at such steep sacred sites; from that setting the character came to mean sheer and, by extension, dangerous. It also carried the idea of purifying a route before a procession, reflected in kendoshin, the attendants who led in front of the coffin during funerals."
