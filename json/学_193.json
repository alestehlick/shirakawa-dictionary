  "explanation": "The character was originally written 學. In its earliest form it sketches a school building, recognizable by the crossed roof timbers (chigi). The graph combines the crossed marks 爻 with an element later written as 臼, which Shirakawa takes as a pair of hands—the act of guiding and instructing. Set above the child 子, the composition becomes 學, expressing the learning of the young. In antiquity, this evoked the rite in which youths, on coming of age, were taught the clan’s traditions and the norms of life under the elders’ supervision. The related 教 (敎) brings together 爻 and 子 with 攴, the striking hand, to show “to teach,” and some old forms of 学 likewise added 攴."
