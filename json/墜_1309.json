  "explanation": "In its earliest form, 墜 combines 隊 and 土. 隊 depicts a sacrificial animal set before 自, whose archaic shape represents the gods’ ladder used for ascent and descent, marking the very spot where deities set foot on earth. 土 shows a rounded mound of soil raised on a stand, an image of the earth deity. Together they signify worship of the earth god at the place of divine descent; hence 墜 originally meant “earth, land, place,” and even functioned as the predecessor of 地. Only later did 墜 shift to the sense of falling or crashing, with the phono-semantic 地 created to carry the meanings of land and place. Beyond “to fall” and “to drop,” 墜 can also mean “to lose,” as in 失墜."
