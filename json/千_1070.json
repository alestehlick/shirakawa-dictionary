  "explanation": "In the earliest scripts on tortoise plastron and bone, as well as in bronze inscriptions, this character is formed by taking the figure of a person (人) and adding a short stroke to the leg, a deliberate notch that distinguishes it from the ordinary 人 and assigns it a numeric value. With this marked “person,” the texts denote the number thousand; and to show two thousand or three thousand, they add the numerals 二 or 三 to that leg portion. The character thus arose as a specially notched human figure used as the sign for a thousand."
