  "explanation": "Classed as a phono-semantic graph. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions it takes the shape of a person, distinguished from the plain person sign 人 by a small extra stroke added at the leg. With this marked form it functions as the numeral ‘thousand’. In those early scripts, ‘two thousand’ and ‘three thousand’ are written by attaching the signs for ‘two’ or ‘three’ to that leg portion of the person figure."
