  "explanation": "This character combines the element kei (匸), a hidden place unknown to people, with 若, which depicts a shaman-priestess (miko) in an entranced state beseeching a divine message. Together they picture a shamaness praying in secrecy at a concealed site, and from this setting the character comes to mean “to hide” and “to conceal.” It also evokes the notion of secret imprecations, and in related usage gives rise to 慝 (toku), where the heart radical joins to express a mind harboring such hidden ill intent."
