  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 慶 as a compound of the graph for the sacred trial beast (the xiezhi, called kaitai in ancient texts and read tai) together with a heart. In divine ordeals, this sheep-like creature embodied the gods’ judgment. When a litigant prevailed, the beast of the winner bore a heart mark on its chest, taken as a kikkei—an auspicious sign—and the character came to express the joy, blessing, and happiness granted by the gods through that victory. From this core sense it later extended to the act of offering congratulations. By contrast, the loser’s beast was slain and, together with the defeated person (the graph of a standing figure, 大) and the oath vessel with its lid removed (the element that forms 去), cast into the river—a scene preserved in the ancient form 灋, the precursor of 法, which depicts this act of consigning to the waters."
