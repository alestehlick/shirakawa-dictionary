  "explanation": "The original form of 真 is 眞, which joins two stark images: 七, taken here as the figure of a person inverted in death, and 県, the image of a head hung upside down. Together they portray one who has suddenly fallen and died in the open. Such an unexpected death was thought to produce a powerful, vengeful spirit, and early ritual centered on appeasing it: bowing before the fallen (as in 顛, to topple), setting the dead respectfully in a small roadside shrine (祠), placing upon a seat a spiritually potent jewel (玉), enshrining the presence (鎭座), calming its wrath (鎭/鎮), and acting with circumspection and reverence (慎). Many graphs built on 眞 reflect facets of this pacification rite. In time, the graph that once marked the fallen dead came to signify what is ultimate and enduring—‘the true’—in line with an ancient view that human life is brief and provisional, while the realm after death is eternal. The shift parallels 久, which originally depicted supporting a corpse from behind and later came to mean ‘long-lasting.’"
