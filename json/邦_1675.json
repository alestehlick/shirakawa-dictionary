  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 邦 as a phono-semantic character: the element 丰 serves as the sound indicator, while the early bronze forms picture a young post set upright atop 士—the original graph of 社, the deity’s shrine—set alongside 邑, a settlement. This composition captures the enfeoffment ceremony by which the Son of Heaven established a fief, planting a marker and founding a domain. From this ritual scene the character comes to mean a feudal territory or country. In contrast, 國 originally denoted the armed, fortified capital, while 邦 points to the territorial state formed through such investiture."
