  "explanation": "This character began as a pictograph of a grain-handling implement: a long sack or box for measuring grain, shown with a mouth for pouring at the top and an outlet below. It corresponds to a winnowing device known as the “wind box that leaves the kernels,” which drives air through harvested grain so the chaff is blown away and only the true seed remains. Because the tool separates the bad from the good, the graph came to mean “good,” and by extension what is genuine and sincere."
