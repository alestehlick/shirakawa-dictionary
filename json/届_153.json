  "explanation": "The original form is 屆, a compound of 尸, the figure of a body laid out, and 由, an element depicting something being set down into an opening. The composition evokes the idea of reaching fully into a space, hence the meanings “to reach” and, by extension, “to deliver.” In the Book of Odes (Major Odes, Decade of Tang), the phrase 靡屆靡研 uses 屆 in precisely this sense—“without limit, without end”—attesting to the notion of reach. In Japanese usage the character naturally covers both sending and arrival: delivering a letter, filing a marriage registration, a present reaching its recipient, and care or attention extending everywhere."
