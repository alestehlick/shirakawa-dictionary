  "explanation": "The “lack” sense of this character goes back to an older form written 缺, a phono‑semantic compound with 夬 as its sound and 缶, the hotogi—an earthenware vessel used for liquids—as its meaning element. In Shirakawa’s view, 夬 originally depicts a hand taking up a ring‑shaped jade with a piece missing, a vivid image of something not whole. Because pottery chips so easily, the graph came to signify a vessel with a piece gone, and by extension the general ideas of lacking, being short of, or insufficient. By contrast, 欠 in its own right draws a person seen in profile with mouth thrust forward, the act of yawning; hence words like 欠伸, the combined yawn and back‑stretch. Although modern usage often writes the “lack” meanings with 欠, the yawning figure and the “chipped vessel” graph arose from different images."
