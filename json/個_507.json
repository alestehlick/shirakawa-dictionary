  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 個 takes 固 as its phonetic, which marks the Sino-Japanese reading ko and suggests the idea of something firm and fixed in shape. From this grows the sense of a single, self-contained entity—one thing or one person—so the character comes to mean an individual and to serve as a general counter affixed to numerals (e.g., ikko ‘one piece’, niko ‘two pieces’). From the Tang period it is also used as a suffix in colloquial Chinese expressions, as in 真個 (shinko, ‘really’) and 這個 (shako, ‘this’)."
