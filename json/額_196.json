  "explanation": "A phono-semantic compound: the head radical 頁 shows that the word concerns the head or brow, while the phonetic element 客 (also written with 各) supplies the sound. Early lexica already gloss it as the forehead. In the Book of Documents, the reduplicated form 額額 depicts an incessant, almost bobbing busyness—like nodding as one moves about. Because the forehead is the most prominent part of the face, the graph naturally broadened to refer to the prominent nameboard or plaque set at the very front of a building, a meaning that underlies its later senses of a framed tablet or frame."
