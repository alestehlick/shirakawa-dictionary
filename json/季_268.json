  "explanation": "季 combines 禾 and 子, with 禾 here not as mere grain but as a headpiece shaped from rice stalks, a symbol of the indwelling rice-plant spirit. The character pictures a child bearing this rice-spirit headgear and dancing in the fields, impersonating the deity to pray for an abundant harvest. Early bronze forms show the child with a raised right arm—the same figure used for a Shang prince—suggesting the nuance of the royal house’s youngest son. Within this ritual complex, 年 depicts a man wearing the rice-spirit headgear in the harvest dance, and 委 a dancing woman; 季 is the youngest child who comes forth to dance. From this it took on the senses of “last” or “youngest,” and, by extension, “season” and “time,” as in shunki (the spring season)."
