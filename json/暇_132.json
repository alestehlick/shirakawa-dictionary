  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character built on the phonetic 艮, which supplies the on reading ka. In early forms 艮 depicts a rock just cut, an unpolished rough stone; from this arose the sense of something still unknown or indeterminate, and by extension notions of the far and the large. When applied to time, this yields the meaning of spare or free time—hima—and extends to itoma, taking one’s leave or time off. The same phonetic idea surfaces in 遐, ‘far,’ and in 假/仮, ‘provisional.’"
