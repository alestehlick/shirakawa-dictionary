  "explanation": "控 is a phono-semantic compound: the hand radical (扌) marks a concrete manual action, while 空 supplies the sound (kō). The Shuowen already glosses it as “to pull,” used of drawing a bow and even of an arrow’s descent, and by extension for tugging at a horse. Zhuangzi (Waiwu) vividly has 控其頤, prying back the jaw to remove the funerary jade set in the mouth of the dead. From these scenes, the character evokes drawing back and holding something in check—Shirakawa even hears in it the creak of the bowstring or the knock against the jaw—an image that naturally broadens in Japanese to hikaeru “to refrain, to hold back,” to the anteroom 控室 where one waits in readiness, and to “jotting down” notes as something kept in reserve."
