  "explanation": "盆 is a phono-semantic character: the dish component 皿 indicates a vessel, while 分 serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading bon. The Shuowen glosses it as a hachi, or bowl, and distinguishes it from 盎: 盎 has a swollen belly and narrow mouth, whereas 盆 describes a vessel with a narrow base and wide mouth. In accounts from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods (Lie Guo), bronze vessels called 盆 are mentioned, shaped much like a water basin (鑑). In later usage it came to denote a flat serving tray for tableware. In Japan, urabon—the mid-seventh-month Buddhist observance for the dead—is commonly shortened to bon or obon."
