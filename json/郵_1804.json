  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 郵 as a compound of 垂 and 邑. 垂 depicts leaves or blossoms hanging down and, by extension, marks the fringes of a realm—the borderland—while 邑 signifies a settlement. Together they point to a facility set at the edge of territory. The Shuowen glosses it as a building from which writings are dispatched to the border, that is, a relay post established for transmitting documents toward the frontier. From this sense came the practice called chiyu, the placement of post stations along routes leading to the border where travel papers were inspected. In modern Japanese the character shifted to the domain of postal services, as seen in words like yubin (mail), yuso (to send by post), and yuken (postage stamp)."
