  "explanation": "Ritually grounded in origin, 儒 is a phono-semantic compound: the person element (亻) combines with 需 as its phonetic. The graph 需 itself joins 雨 “rain” with 而, the figure of a person with shorn hair and no topknot—a sign of shamanic function—evoking the rite of praying for rain even under clear skies. From this rain-invocation comes 需’s senses “to demand” and “to wait,” and by extension 儒 first named those shamans who performed such ceremonies. These were lower-ranking ritual specialists who also handled and calculated the arrangements for the funerals of wealthy families. Out of this milieu emerged Confucius (6th–5th century BCE), who articulated a universal Way and set in motion what became 儒教 and 儒学; thereafter 儒 came to denote Confucian teaching and the scholars who embody it."
