  "explanation": "汗 is a phono-semantic character: the water element on the left signals a liquid, while 干 functions as the phonetic, giving the on reading kan. The character names the moisture that exudes from the body—sweat—distinct from other bodily fluids marked by different graphs: tears from the eyes (淚, 涕), nasal mucus (洟), the pair 涕洟 for tears and mucus together, and saliva from the mouth (唾, 液). In this composition, 干 also subtly points back to the body’s frame, anchoring the idea in what issues directly from the skin. Thus 汗 designates perspiration, the body’s own outflow."
