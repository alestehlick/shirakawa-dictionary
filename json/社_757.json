  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 社 combines 示, the altar or offering table used in worship, with a right-hand element originally written as 士/土, a rounded clod of earth that both gives the sound and depicts the earth deity itself. In oracle-bone forms, small dots appear on this earthen mound, indicating the sprinkling of purifying liquor over the god. A yashiro, or shrine, was first the sacred place where this earth deity was revered—an open structure without a roof raised over the altar. Mountains, rivers, and clustered groves were likewise conceived as divine abodes, and trees were often planted above each region’s earth-god mound. As worship later moved into built sanctuaries, these became the jinja, Shinto shrines. From the shrine as a community center, the character’s meaning extended to organized groups, seen in words like kessha (association) and kaisha (company)."
