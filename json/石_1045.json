  "explanation": "This character is a compound of the cliff form 厂 and a ritual container 口/囗 known as the sai, a box for depositing written prayers to the gods. In early script it evokes a great rock by a cliff that was revered as the dwelling place of a divine spirit, with petitions offered in that covenant receptacle. Shuowen glosses it as a “mountain stone,” and over time the sense broadened to the general meaning of “stone.” Related graphs preserve this cultic background: 祏 denotes the spirit tablet set in an ancestral mausoleum, and 宕 names the “stone chamber” where the Son of Heaven performed rites to heaven and earth, all testifying to an ancient faith centered on sacred stones."
