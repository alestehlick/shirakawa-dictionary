  "explanation": "An indicative character built on 木 “tree,” 末 adds a bold mark at the top of the trunk to show the tree’s extremity—its treetop. From this graphic focus on the uppermost tip, the character came to mean “treetop,” then more generally “end,” and by extension “future” or the “latter part.” In deliberate contrast, 本 places the mark at the base of the tree to indicate its root or foundation. The paired notion of 本 and 末 is preserved in expressions like 本末, evoking the relation between basis and end, root and branch, or beginning and outcome."
