  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the “streamer” element depicts a pennant attached to a flagpole, while 其 supplies the sound ki and originally pictured a square winnowing basket (箕), carrying the idea of something square—just as in 棋, a square game board. The flag in early usage was a nearly square military standard. Ancient practice prescribed specific signals—raising a blue-green flag to indicate a river ahead, or a tiger hide when enemy forces were sighted—and armies were directed by such flags, so 旗下 came to mean troops under the general’s banner, the main battle line. In later times flags served as shop signs, giving rise to terms like 旗亭 (restaurant/inn) and 酒旗 (tavern sign). A related banner, 旌, was used to adorn and honor, hence 旌表 “to commend.”"
