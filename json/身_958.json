  "explanation": "This character is a pictograph of a woman seen from the side with a markedly swollen belly, evoking pregnancy. In the Book of Odes (Greater Odes, Da Ming), the phrase 大任有身, “Tai Ren conceived,” preserves this original sense of 身 as ‘to become pregnant.’ Related graphs support the image: 孕 depicts a child within the mother’s abdomen, and 包 likewise shows an unborn infant enclosed. From this core image of conception, the meaning broadened over time to denote the ‘body’ and, by extension, ‘oneself.’"
