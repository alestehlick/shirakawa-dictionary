  "explanation": "In its earliest forms, this character sketched a small, tent‑like building. A related graph read riku shows the figure of 六 stacked or piled, echoing that shape. The concrete sense of a little shelter fell out of use, and the character was taken over as a phonetic loan; thus it came to denote the numeral “six,” retaining the sound while shifting to the numerical meaning."
