  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character formed with the person element and the phonetic 卬. In the ancient script, 卬 depicts two figures confronting one another vertically: a person below, face turned upward, and another above pressing down. Seen from below, the image gives aogu—looking up to and revering; seen from above, it suggests suppressing or pressing down. Read as a sequence of before and after, the relation also shades into mukaeru, going out to meet someone ahead. From the core sense of looking up toward one of higher rank, the character came to mean receiving a noble’s words—hence oose, a command. Expressions like ten o aogu, to look up to heaven, and gyouten, to be astounded, preserve these nuances. The phonetic 卬 also provides the on reading kō."
