  "explanation": "暁 is a phono-semantic character whose traditional form is 曉. The element 尭 serves as the phonetic, giving the On reading gyou; in ancient depiction it shows earthenware piled on kiln boards during firing, and by extension carries the sense of something raised or high. With the sun component, the character pictures the moment when the sun begins to climb—the first light of day at dawn. As that light spreads and the shapes of things come into view, the meaning naturally extends to perceiving or realizing."
