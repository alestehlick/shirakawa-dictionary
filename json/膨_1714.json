  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the left component 月 (nikuzuki, “flesh”) marks a part of the body, while the right component 彭 functions as the phonetic. 彭 itself combines the image of a drum with a sign of resplendence to suggest reverberating drumbeats and, by extension, fullness, vigor, and prosperity. With the flesh radical added, the sense narrows to swelling that seems to rise from within the body, especially in the abdominal area. Hence its core meaning “to swell, to puff up,” seen in compounds like 膨大 (vast, enormous) and 膨張 (expansion, swelling)."
