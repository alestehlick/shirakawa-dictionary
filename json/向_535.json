  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 向 as a graph built from a window-like frame and the square 口, which here represents sai, the sacred container for covenantal writings offered to the gods. In the loess regions of northern China, semi-subterranean dwellings often had a single window, and the shaft of light entering that opening was felt as the advent of a deity. People placed offerings at the window to greet and worship the divine presence. Thus, the original sense of 向 is the window as a place of welcoming and veneration. Only later was the character used for 嚮, extending to meanings such as to face, to turn toward, and by association, ahead or what lies before one."
