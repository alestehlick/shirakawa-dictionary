  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: in bronze inscriptions it follows the walking sign 辵 (later the left-side 彳), combined with 士 as a phonetic giving the sound to. The Shuowen glosses it “to walk, to go,” which underlies the sense of going on foot (toho). Because 士 is the ancient graph that also stands at the root of 社, the shrine-centered community, 徒 came to denote the people attached to such a shrine—hence companions, a group, or the people at large. By further extension it is used adverbially for senses like mere or only, and sometimes for alone."
