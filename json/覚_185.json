  "explanation": "The original form is 覺, a picto‑phonetic character with 學 on top as the phonetic. That upper part, read kaku, also carries the idea of learning: Shirakawa sees it as a ritual learning hall, its roof marked by chigi, with the teacher’s two hands guiding and a child below—an image of instruction. When the element 見, “to see,” is placed underneath, the graph comes to mean waking to something one sees and understands—perception and realization. From this core of becoming aware it naturally extends to ‘awaken’ (mezameru, sameru) and ‘perceive’ (satoru), and in Japanese also to ‘learn, remember’ (oboeru)."
