  "explanation": "Shirakawa interprets 既 as a compound of 自 and 旡. It pictures a person who, after eating, turns away with a full belly and lets out a belch, the utensil element 自 set before him. From this vivid scene of a meal brought to completion, the character takes on the senses of coming to an end and already having been done. Related graphs such as 嘅 and 慨 carry this meaning forward, turning the released breath after completion into the sigh and lament they express."
