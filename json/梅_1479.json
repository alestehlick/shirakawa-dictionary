  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: 木 “tree” provides the meaning, while 每 (in the usual form) or 某 (in the variant 楳) supplies the sound. Early sources glossed 某 as a “sour fruit,” and in older graphic tradition 某 combined a covenant-receptacle shaped like 日 hung from a tree branch, a rite of dedicating petitions and consulting the divine will—a background that also underlies characters such as 謀. In 梅 this structure names the ume, the Chinese Japanese apricot. The tree reached Japan by the Nara period; the word was then read with the Chinese méi, which, with a prefixed vowel, became the native ume (and in the Heian era also mume). Plum blossoms were long cherished in China and Japan; the Man’yoshu preserves many poems praising their beauty, and their fragrance was once esteemed even above the cherry’s."
