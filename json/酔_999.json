  "explanation": "Originally written 醉, this is a phono-semantic character: 酉 depicts a wine vessel, and 卒 acts as the phonetic that gives the on reading sui and, in this series, often carries a sense of things scattering or losing cohesion (as seen in characters like 碎 and 蔡). Placed beside the wine jar, that nuance captures the loosening of composure brought on by alcohol, hence the meaning to get drunk. By extension, as in 心酔, it came to describe being wholly absorbed or fascinated, even indulging oneself in deep admiration."
