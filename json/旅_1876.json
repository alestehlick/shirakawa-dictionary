  "explanation": "旅 is a compound graph that brings together the image of a flagpole with a streaming banner—the clan standard—and the form 从, depicting people aligned one behind another, the old shape of 従. The ancient figure shows a clan column advancing under its banner, and from this it came to mean setting out on a long road, hence “travel.” In clan affairs one moved with the standard held aloft; related ideas cluster around this emblem: 族 evokes the rite of swearing an oath beneath the clan flag, and 遊 suggests raising a banner imbued with the clan’s spirit. In antiquity, a 旅 was often a purposeful journey, such as pilgrimages to worship mountain and river deities or visits to branch shrines."
