  "explanation": "織 is a phono-semantic character with 戬 as its phonetic. 戬 originally depicted a pike adorned with decorative streamers, treated as a marked sign, with red silk seemingly spread as ornament; the brilliance suggested by 熾 (“blazing”) resonates with this image. The character first meant “textile,” especially patterned cloth, as seen in a bronze inscription reading 賜女戬衣, “I present you with decorated garments,” which records the bestowal of designed textiles for ritual wear. In this sense, 戬 is the original written form of 織. The dazzling patterned silks excavated at Mawangdui from the Han period give a vivid impression of such fabrics. From the notion of fine textiles and twilled silk, the word broadened to mean “to weave” and, by extension, the craft of weaving."
