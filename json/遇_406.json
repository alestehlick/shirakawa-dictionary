  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 遇 takes its sound from 禺, which Shirakawa interprets as the figure of a crouching, watchful animal with an oversized head—a form reminiscent of the clay or wooden effigies that stood in for deities or notable persons (偶人). Meeting such an uncanny stand-in would be an extraordinary event, and so the character came to mean an unexpected encounter, as seen in expressions like 遇然 “by chance.” Because such encounters demand care and respect, the sense broadened to treatment or handling, as in 優遇 “to treat favorably.” Here, 禺 serves as the phonetic core (giving the on reading guu) while guiding the character’s development from “to meet” to “to treat.”"
