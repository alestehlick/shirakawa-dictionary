  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 歩 as a compound of two footprint signs: 止, the standard footprint, paired with 少, which in its earliest form mirrors 止. Early graphs set a left footprint with a right one behind it, and conversely a right with a left behind, vividly showing the alternating motion of the legs. From this image the character comes to mean walking, going, and a single step. In ancient ritual thinking, to place one’s feet on the ground and walk was to make contact with the spirit of the local soil; approaching important ceremonial sites on foot was therefore an act of respect toward that earth spirit."
