  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: 馬 supplies the sense of the horse and, by extension, the act of mounting or sitting astride, while 奇 gives the on-yomi ki and carries the nuance of “single.” In contrast to war chariots that could be driven three-abreast by adding side horses to a central team, 騎 denotes riding a single horse—horseback riding—as in kiba. Thus the graph came to signify a mounted rider and, by extension, cavalry, a form of warfare that rose to prominence from the Spring and Autumn through the Warring States period."
