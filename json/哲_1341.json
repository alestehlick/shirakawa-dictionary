  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character with 折 (setsu) providing the sound, 哲 draws its imagery from ritual acts. In antiquity, 折 depicted cutting grasses or wood with the ax 斤—an action performed as a solemn gesture when swearing to the gods. In bronze inscriptions of 恝, taken as the prototype of 哲, some forms add the ax to the sign of the gods’ ladder, the ladder by which deities descend and ascend, suggesting the making of a divine ladder with an ax to welcome them. From this scene—pledging before the gods, preparing their descent, and fixing the mind in clarity—arises the sense of lucid realization and, by extension, intelligence and wisdom."
