  "explanation": "投 is a compound of 手 “hand” and 殳, a long cane pike that, in ancient practice, was sometimes adorned with bird feathers. 殳 is the original graph for the weapon itself; adding 手 highlights the act of grasping and wielding it. In early usage the character described brandishing or striking with this pike to drive away malevolent spirits in rites of expulsion. A passage in the Zuo Zhuan says 投諸四裔, “cast it to the four borders,” vividly conveying the idea of flinging something outward to banish it to the margins. From this ritual sense developed the familiar meanings “to throw” and, especially, “to cast away.”"
