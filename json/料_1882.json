  "explanation": "Formed from the graphs for rice (米) and the ladle-measure 斗, 料 pictures grain being measured out with a handled scoop. In early lexicography it is defined straightforwardly as “to measure,” specifically the measuring of quantity. From that concrete scene the sense broadened to measuring or comparing in general, and then to what is measured out for use: materials for making things, and by extension provisions and food, as seen in compounds like 材料, 飼料, and 食料."
