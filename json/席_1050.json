  "explanation": "In its old form, 席 combines the profile of a building (厂) with the straw mat (蓆). A mat spread out within a building marks a person’s place, giving the senses of a mat and a seat, and by extension the act of laying something out. Shirakawa distinguishes 筵 as the mat laid directly on bare ground, while 席 is the additional covering placed on top. In formal etiquette, people seated before elders kept a distance of one jō (about 3.03 m) between mats; from this, kanjō (“inserting a jō”) later came to refer to the courteous side addition to an address in a letter. Because mats are rolled up and stored, compounds like 席捲/席巻 evoke sweeping across and taking possession, as if rolling up a mat."
