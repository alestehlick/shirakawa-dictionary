  "explanation": "The character began as a picture of a tortoise’s plastron, the belly shell marked by two seam lines that intersect at the center, drawn as a simple cross in oracle-bone and early forms. Later, scribes added the upper outline of the shell, yielding the shape now recognized as 甲. By likening a warrior’s protection to the tortoise’s hard casing, the graph came to mean armor and, by extension, a helmet. It also names the first of the ten heavenly stems, from which it further conveys the sense of being the first or occupying the leading rank."
