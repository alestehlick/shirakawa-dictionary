  "explanation": "A picto-phonetic graph. In oracle-bone and bronze forms it shows a sacred bird wearing a crested headpiece—the same numinous bird that underlies 鳳 (phoenix). The element 凡 was added as a marker for the Sino-Japanese reading. As ideas shifted toward dragons dwelling in the heavens and stirring the air, the bird of 鳳 was set aside and the reptile/dragon sign 虫 was introduced, giving 風 its received form and the sense of wind. Thus the character does not depict moving air; it evokes a spirit-creature, bird- or dragon-like, that brings the wind. In antiquity the wind was imagined as a bird-shaped deity that ranged across the land, touching every place and shaping each region’s distinctive 風俗 (customs) and 風物 (natural scenes and things)."
