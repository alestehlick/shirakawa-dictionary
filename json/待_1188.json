  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the left side 彳 suggests moving or proceeding—and by extension the passage of time—while the right side 寺 serves as the phonetic and also evokes the idea of holding or sustaining a condition. Together they express keeping oneself in a poised state as time goes by, hence “to wait” and “to await,” and by extension “to prepare (for)” and “to treat/receive” others. Shirakawa further notes that this graph appears to have differentiated from an earlier form written like 祉, which in oracle-bone inscriptions bore the value “shi” with the sense of “long,” and in bronze inscriptions the value “ku” with the sense “to go”; 待 then settled into the specialized notion of awaiting in readiness."
