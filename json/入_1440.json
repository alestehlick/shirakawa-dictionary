  "explanation": "This character is a pictograph of an entryway: two large posts set up together to form the opening to a room. When a roof-like element is added above this doorway shape, it becomes 内, evoking the covered space one has gone into and thus the sense of “inside.” Retaining the original gateway alone gives 入, which focuses on the action itself—going in or putting something in through an entrance."
