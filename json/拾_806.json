  "explanation": "拾 is a phono-semantic character: the hand element implies action, while 合 serves as the phonetic and conceptual core. In ancient form, 合 depicts a vessel fitted with its lid, an image of things coming together. By extension, 拾 expresses gathering and bringing scattered things into order. Its On reading follows 合, though the sound has shifted over time, as seen in other characters with altered Sino-Japanese readings. This sense of orderly collection appears in compounds like 拾収 (shushu), which denotes putting confusion in good order. The graph is also used as a substitute for 渉, giving the reading shō in expressions such as 拾級 (shōkyū), describing ascending steps carefully, level by level. To prevent easy alteration of numerals, 拾 is sometimes written in place of 十 in contexts like amounts and tallies."
