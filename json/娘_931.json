  "explanation": "This is a picto-phonetic graph formed with the woman element and a phonetic. In its older form 孃, the phonetic was 襄, which also means to swell or grow full, conjuring the image of a well-shaped, full-bosomed woman. From that image the character came to denote a woman in her prime and, by extension, the roles of mother and daughter. The later graph 娘, using 良 as its phonetic, came into common use from the Sui and Tang periods. The cultural life of the word is vivid: Sui records speak of the 娘子軍, a “women’s army,” and in China the 娘娘廟—temples to the Niángniáng goddess who grants children—drew lively popular devotion. These usages underscore the character’s enduring association with womanhood and childbirth."
