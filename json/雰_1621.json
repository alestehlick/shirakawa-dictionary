  "explanation": "雰 is a phono-semantic character: the rain radical evokes weather, while the phonetic 分 supplies the on reading fun. 分 originally portrayed cutting something in two with a knife; from that image comes 粉, “powder,” grains broken into fine particles. In the same way, 雰 depicts rain become minute droplets—light mist or fog—and it appears in compounds like 雰囲気, the surrounding atmosphere or mood. The Shuowen glosses the related graph 氛 as an auspicious manifestation of qi, reflecting the old view that the states of weather between heaven and earth reveal fortune or misfortune. In early texts the form 氛 is used; adding the rain element later sharpened the meteorological nuance to give 雰."
