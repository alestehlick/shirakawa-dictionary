  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 慈 takes its sound from 茲 (also standing in for 滋), a graph meaning to grow, increase, and raise, while the character as a whole names the feeling that fosters and cares—hence to cherish, to love, and by extension sympathy and a compassionate heart. Bronze inscriptions even write the verb itsukushimu with 子, showing that 子, 茲/滋, 慈, and 孳 belong to a single lineage centered on growth, breeding, and nurture; in 慈 that productive sense is internalized as an emotion of caring."
