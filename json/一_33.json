  "explanation": "Shirakawa takes 一 as an indicative sign: the simple form of a single wooden counting rod laid horizontally. In the oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, numbers were recorded with such rods; 二 and 三 are this same element repeated in layers. As the starting point of enumeration it also bears the sense of “beginning,” and, because it gathers things into a single sum, it naturally extends to meanings like “the whole, all.”"
