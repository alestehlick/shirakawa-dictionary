  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 金 as a pictograph of metal cast in an earthen mold. The central outline shows the profile of a standardized mold with its gate cut away, and the small adjoining strokes mark the little globules or lumps of cast copper, making the idea of “metal” explicit. In early usage 金 meant metal in general—and especially copper, the base material for bronze vessels—while bronze (“blue‑green copper”) was contrasted with akagane, “red metal,” i.e., copper. Later the character came to denote yellow gold and, by extension, wealth and money, and from the Warring States period onward objects made of gold became increasingly common."
