  "explanation": "This character began as a pictograph of a kitchen hearth with a pot set upon it. From the image of food thoroughly cooked on the stove, it came to express degree—“very,” “intense,” “extreme.” Related graphs illuminate the scene: 斟 shows ladling out something well cooked with a dipper (斗), and 酌 depicts drawing drink from a cask; together they yield 斟酌, literally “ladling and measuring,” hence the idea of weighing things with careful consideration. When the fire element was added to 甚, a character for the stove itself was formed. From the savoring of a well-prepared meal, the sense broadened to enjoyment more generally, coloring words for pleasure—at times even erotic delight—and 湛 can also stand in this role, meaning to enjoy or to be deeply absorbed, alongside its basic sense “to sink.”"
