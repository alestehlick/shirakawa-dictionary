  "explanation": "A picto-phonetic character: the phonetic element (read sei) evokes the idea of conquest—attacking and subduing a fortified city—while the semantic 攴 depicts a hand brandishing a whip. Together they portray the act of compelling a newly subjugated populace to render taxes and tribute. Bronze inscriptions of the Zhou period preserve this fiscal sense, as in phrases noting an office charged with receiving tribute from the four quarters at Chengzhou (Luoyang). From this core of levy and tribute grew the broader meanings of ruling and statecraft, hence its later use for governing and for politics."
