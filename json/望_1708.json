  "explanation": "In the oracle-bone script, the graph shows an eye with an enlarged pupil (the form later written as 臣) set above a person in profile standing on tiptoe (shaped like 壬): a figure craning upward to see far into the distance. Later, with 亡 added as the phonetic element supplying the on-reading, the character took the form 望. From the act of searching and sighting afar, its sense broadened to hope, wish, expect, and look forward to. The poised stance and powerful gaze recall ancient practices of cloud- and weather-watching and divination, as well as the believed malefic force of the eye that could subdue enemies. Oracle-bone texts even record the clan name 望乗 (Wangcheng/Bōjō), likely a group that accompanied armies, charged with discerning the enemy’s condition through the potency of that vigilant gaze."
