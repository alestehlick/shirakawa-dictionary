  "explanation": "In the oracle-bone and bronze forms, 得 is a compound that combines 彳 (the “go, walk” element from 行) with 貝 (cowry) and the hand sign 又 or 寸. It pictures setting out and taking a cowry shell in one’s hand. Cowries, brought from the Southern Seas and prized as valuables—and even used as currency—made the act of grasping a shell a concrete image of acquisition. From this scene arises the core sense “to obtain, to gain,” which naturally extends to “can, be able to.” Over time the notion of acquisition broadened from goods to insight, giving the character its further uses for “to understand” and “to attain enlightenment.”"
