  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph, 稿 combines 禾 “grain” with the phonetic 高. Shirakawa reads 高 as the image of a covenant coffer for depositing prayer texts to the gods, to which the withered upper bones of the dead are added—an image that lends connotations of condolence, pallor, and a smooth, calm surface. In early explanations, the ancient form 稾 is “wheat straw”; related 槁 describes wood that has withered and turned white, while 稾 denotes dried, lustrous straw. From this material sense, the character came to mean a draft or rough copy, because such preliminary writing was done on coarse straw paper, even in hurried strokes."
