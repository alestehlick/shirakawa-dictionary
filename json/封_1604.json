  "explanation": "The old form of 封 combines three elements: 丰, the figure of a young tree; 土, the earth that is also the basis of the shrine (the original form of 社); and 又, a hand. Together they depict planting a tree by hand at a sacred site, a rite for inviting a deity’s presence. From this solemn act evolved the political sense of enfeoffment—distributing the Son of Heaven’s land and appointing lords (封建). Related expressions preserve the ritual background: 封樹 is the heaping of earth on a grave and planting a tree, and 封禅 is the ceremony in which the Son of Heaven raises altars and offers worship to heaven and earth. In later usage, with the on reading fuu, the character means to shut or seal, as in 封鎖, 封書, 封筒, and 密封."
