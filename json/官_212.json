  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 官 as a compound of a roof and the figure of a sacrificial offering: under the eaves lies the “worship meat” that served as the army’s tutelary spirit. Before a campaign, troops offered meat at the army shrine, then bore it aloft as they set out; when encamped, it was installed in a building. 官 originally named that sacred place of enshrinement within the military encampment. Because generals resided there, the idea extended to their quarters, later written as 館, for which 官 is the original graph. From the practice of dividing this meat when the army operated in detachments, related graphs arose: the figure of raising the offering led to 遣, “to send, dispatch,” and the act of cutting the meat with a hilted knife defined 師, the authorized military commander. On returning from campaign, reporting at the mausoleum and ritually purifying it produced 歸, combining the offering, footprints of return, and a broom. In origin, characters built on this element belong to the sphere of military rites; only later did 官 come to mean the public office and the official who administers it."
