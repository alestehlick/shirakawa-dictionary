  "explanation": "第 is a phono‑semantic character: 竹 shows the bamboo slips (chikukan) that served as writing materials, and an abbreviated form of 弟 functions as the phonetic, indicating the On reading tei/dai. As the Shuowen explains, it originally evoked bamboo slips bound neatly in order with a leather thong (韋), hence the idea of arranging things in proper sequence. From this core meaning come its roles as an ordinal marker and as a word for ranking, as well as its use in compounds like 及第, “to pass an examination.” By extension, the On reading tei was also employed as a substitute for 邸, giving the sense “mansion” in certain contexts."
