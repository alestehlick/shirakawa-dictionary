  "explanation": "A phono-semantic compound: the stone element combines with the phonetic楚 (so).楚 originally evoked thorny brushwood and thickets where roots spread widely, an image of firm rooting and support. From this, the character came to mean the foundation stone that anchors a building (ishizue), and by extension the basis or groundwork of anything. The sense is preserved in compounds such as 定礎 (teiso), the ceremonial laying of a foundation stone; 礎業 (sogyo), laying the basis of an undertaking; and 礎案 (soan), a basic draft."
