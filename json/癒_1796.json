  "explanation": "癒 is a phono-semantic character built on the graph 兪 (yu), which provides the sound and the core image. In 兪, 舟 is not a boat but a tub or shallow vessel, and 余 is the form of a handled surgical knife; together they depict lancing an abscess so that pus and blood drain into a tub—an act that restores the body, hence “to heal” and “to recover.” The related graphs 愉 and 愈 (yu) likewise speak of a wound or illness mending and the mind settling into ease. When 愈 later broadened to mean “to surpass; ever more,” the “sickbed” radical 疒—shaped like a patient lying on a bed—was added to create 癒, making the sense of recovery from illness explicit. The Shuowen glosses the cognate 瘉 (yu) as “a sickness heals,” and ancient Chinese medicine already practiced operative treatment with narcotics—the very procedure the graph evokes."
