  "explanation": "Tea is written as a phono-semantic compound: the grass radical signals a plant, while the lower element 余 functions as the phonetic, giving the sound and echoed by characters that share it. In the oldest lexica the word was not yet written as 茶; the earlier form was 荼, and 余 served as the sound marker in related graphs. Classical sources help trace the transition: the Erya glosses 檟 as “bitter tea,” and the Jingdian Shiwen explains 荼 as a kind of late-picked tea, effectively the same entity later written 茶. Lu Yu’s Tang-dynasty Classic of Tea then sets out the craft in full—production, drinking, origins, and more. From the Song and Yuan onward, tea became the daily companion of the literati, and in Japan, brought with Zen in the Kamakura period, it was first taken as medicine before maturing into the Way of Tea."
