  "explanation": "Shirakawa interprets 可 as a compound: a covenant vessel that holds written prayers to the gods is struck with a branch (丁), a forceful act meant to press the gods to realize the petition. From this ritual of assertive pleading—demanding that the wish must be fulfilled—comes the sense of assent and permission, the gods’ “all right.” Thus 可 came to mean what is allowed or approved; 許可 (“permission”) originally denotes divine sanction. The graph also underlies 呵 (“to scold, reproach”), preserving the notion of strong pressing."
