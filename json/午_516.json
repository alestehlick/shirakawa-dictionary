  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 午 as a pictograph of a wooden mallet (kine) used in apotropaic cursing rites to ward off harm. This ritual sense ties it to 御/禦, the act of warding or controlling: the oldest graphs for 御 look like a bundled mass of threads, but later forms converge toward the shape seen in 午; when the mallet is shown explicitly as a curse implement it appears as 卸, which he takes to be the original writing of 御. From this ritual object the character was later borrowed as the name of one of the Twelve Earthly Branches; in calendrical use it came to denote the noon hour, and in the zodiac it was paired with the horse. The graph is also used with the sense “to go against.”"
