  "explanation": "浴 is a phono-semantic character: the water element provides the sense of washing, while the phonetic is the special 谷 used as an On-reading marker in this series—not the “valley” koku, but the 谷 seen in 俗, 容, 欲. Shirakawa describes 容 as the act of presenting a ritual covenant vessel (sai) that holds written petitions in an ancestral mausoleum, with the divine pneuma faintly manifesting above; 欲 expresses the desire to behold that epiphany. In this ritual setting, 浴 denotes the ablutions performed in preparation for mausoleum prayer, and by extension it came to mean bathing and pouring water over oneself. In ancient practice, water was also poured over prisoners of war and the dead for purification and exorcism, even as a rite of revival. Relatedly, 沐 refers to washing the hair, and 沐浴 to the full lustration of hair and body."
