  "explanation": "In the oracle-bone and bronze forms, 疾 combines 大, the front view of a person standing with arms and legs spread, with 矢, an arrow, to picture someone struck under the arm—an arrow wound. In later script the human figure 大 was reshaped into the sickness radical 疒, the image of a person lying on a bed (牀), and the character came to mean illness in general. Early usage even glossed “疾 is 病,” with 病 referring in particular to severe disease. From the core idea of affliction the word broadened: it came to express hostile or envious feeling, as in 疾視 and in jealousy terms, and also the sense of swiftness, as in 疾風 and compounds describing speed."
