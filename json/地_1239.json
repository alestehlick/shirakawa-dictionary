  "explanation": "In this graph, 也 serves as the phonetic, signaling the on-reading chi/ji, as it does in characters like 池 and 馳. Shirakawa traces the origin back to 墜, a form composed of 隊 and 土. 隊 depicts a sacrificial animal set before 阜—the divine “ladder” for the gods’ ascent and descent—marking the spot where deities set foot. 土 is the earthen mound embodying the earth god. Thus 墜 originally expressed worship of the earth gods at the very place of the gods’ landing. When 墜 later shifted in sense to “to fall,” the new phono-semantic character 地 was created: 土 provides the semantic element “earth/ground,” and 也 supplies the sound. From this formation, 地 came to mean land, earth, ground, and by extension, place."
