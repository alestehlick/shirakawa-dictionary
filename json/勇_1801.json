  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 勇 as a phonetic–semantic graph that pairs 甬 with 力. The element 甬, originally the picture of a bucket, serves as the phonetic and is the same component seen in 涌/湧, words for water welling up from a spring. 力 is the form of a plough, evoking the kind of concentrated exertion needed to work the fields in one sustained push. Together they suggest power rising from within and being applied in a single, unhesitating effort to see a task through—hence the senses of bravery and strength. In Japanese this becomes the lively isamu “to be in high spirits,” as in the over-eager step of 勇み足."
