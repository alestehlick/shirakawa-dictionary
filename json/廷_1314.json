  "explanation": "This is a phono-semantic character. In bronze inscriptions, the element 壬 serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading tei, and depicts a person pouring libations to purify the earth deity, shown as a mound of soil set on a stand. The component 廴 portrays the wall that encloses and separates that ritual precinct. Together they designate a sacred court or yard where ceremonies were performed; by extension it came to mean the place where affairs of state were handled and trials conducted, hence also a government office."
