  "explanation": "This is a phono-semantic character: the earth/clay element points to an earthen structure, while the phonetic 亘—also seen in characters read en such as 洹 (the name of a river)—serves as the on-reading indicator and originally suggested a line encircling a space. 垣 therefore denotes the clay wall that surrounds a building, hence “fence” or “hedge.” In antiquity its on reading matched that of 院, which originally referred to a sacred precinct or building furnished with such an enclosing wall. Early forms even show the encircling element set against fortress walls, emphasizing that a 垣 was the earthen enclosure of a fort."
