  "explanation": "講 is a phono-semantic character built from 言, “speech,” and 冓 (kou) as the phonetic. 冓 originally depicts strings of identical ornaments tied together above and below, conveying the idea of assembling or putting things together. That image carries into compounds like 構築, where timber is put together to build. In 講, the notion is applied to words: gathering and arranging speech to expound, explain, consider, devise plans, and teach—hence its senses of lecture, explanation, planning, and instruction."
