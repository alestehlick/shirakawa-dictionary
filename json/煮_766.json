  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 煮 as a phono-semantic graph: the fire element gives the sense of heating, while 者 provides the sound. The underlying image for “boiling,” however, was originally expressed by 庶, which portrays a pan set beneath a roof in a kitchen, with fire below—an unmistakable scene of cooking. 者, by contrast, depicted a ritual earthen fence with buried charms, an image of warding and obstruction that rightly appears in characters such as 遮 “to block.” Because 者 (zhe/sha) and 庶 (shu/sho) are phonetically close, their forms were early on conflated—already visible in bronze inscriptions—and the graph with 者 over fire, 煮, became the standard character for “to boil.” In 煮, then, 者 chiefly marks the reading, while the act of boiling reflects the kitchen-and-pan imagery embodied in 庶."
