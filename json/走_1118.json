  "explanation": "A pictograph of running: the upper element sketches a human figure with one arm raised, the other lowered, the body leaning forward in a runner’s posture, while the lower element 止 shows footprints or steps, emphasizing forward motion. Hence the basic sense is to run. From this base, 奔 was formed by combining the same figure with multiple 止 to express even swifter running, giving compounds like 奔走, ‘to run about busily,’ a term used in ritual contexts for the rapid movements required during worship, as in the Sacrificial Odes of the Book of Odes: ‘Grandly they hurried about in the temple.’"
