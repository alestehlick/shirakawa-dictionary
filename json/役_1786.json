  "explanation": "This character combines 彳, the step beside the crossroads in 行 that signifies going or marching, with 殳, a hand-held striking weapon like a pike. Together they evoke taking up arms and setting out to the border to stand guard. From this image 役 first expressed warfare and military service, and then broadened to the state-imposed corvée, to work and duties in general, and by extension to functions and the people who perform them."
