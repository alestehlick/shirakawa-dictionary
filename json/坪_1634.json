  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: 土, the earth radical, gives the sense of ground, while 平 serves as the phonetic and evokes the idea of levelness—its ancient form shows wood being hewn flat with a hand axe. The Shuowen glosses it as “flat ground,” that is, a stretch of level soil. In Japan it came to be read tsubo and used as a standard measure of area, a square of six shaku on a side—about 3.3 square meters—seen in terms such as tatetsubo (建坪, floor area) and tsubosū (坪数, number of tsubo)."
