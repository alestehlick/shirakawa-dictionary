  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 敬 as a compound of 苟 and 攴. In the oracle-bone script, 苟 shows a kneeling figure with a ram’s head—understood as a captured Qiang person prepared for sacrifice. 攴 depicts a hand holding a short switch, the act of striking. Together they picture an admonitory rite: a covenant vessel holding written petitions to the gods was set before the sacrificial captive, while the officiant, striking from behind with the switch, carried out the gods’ warning and command. From this ritual of prayer and awe-filled admonition arose the sense of 敬 as the reverent heart—respect, honor, and deference in serving the divine."
