  "explanation": "維 is a phono-semantic character. The silk radical 糸 points to threadwork, while 隹 functions as the phonetic, giving the on reading i, as in related characters like 唯 and 帷. Its original image is of fibers twisted into a strong cord—hence meanings such as rope and the acts of binding or tying—and by extension the idea of fiber itself, as in 繊維. In classical diction it can also serve as an adverbial particle meaning “just so/thereby,” a nuance that lives on in 維新 “renewal, restoration,” a phrase celebrated from the Book of Odes (Major Odes, King Wen): “its mandate was renewed.”"
