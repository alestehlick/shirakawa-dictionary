  "explanation": "命 combines 令 and 口. In Shirakawa’s view, 令 shows a kneeling officiant wearing a deep ceremonial hood as they receive a revelation from the gods, while 口 here is not a mouth but the ritual receptacle (sai) that holds prayer texts or covenant documents. The character thus signifies what is bestowed as a divine message in response to prayer—hence a mandate or command. Because human life was regarded as Heaven’s bestowal, the graph also came to mean “life,” and by extension “destiny” or “fate.” In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, 令 often appears with the value of 命, indicating that 令 is the original form for this concept."
