  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the right component 且 serves as the phonetic and gives the on reading so, and it already carries the sense “to check, to obstruct.” The left component is 阝 (from 阜), originally depicting the divine ladder by which gods ascended and descended; placing something upon it signifies setting up a barrier to block another’s approach. From this ritual image the character comes to mean barring or thwarting an intrusion. Classical usage confirms the concrete sense of natural impediments: in the Zhou Rites, officials are charged “to know the obstacles” posed by mountains, forests, rivers, and marshes, whence the extended sense seen in compounds like 険阻 “rugged, dangerous.” By further extension it can describe being held back or afflicted, as in being “blocked by hunger,” i.e., suffering from hunger."
