  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 惑 as a phono-semantic character formed from 心, the heart-mind, and 或 as the phonetic. In the older forms, 或 depicts a walled enclosure (the city walls) guarded with a spear 戈—an image that also lies behind 域, “a bounded domain.” As an independent word, 或 appears in 或いは aruiwa, “or, perhaps,” evoking the presence of alternatives. Placed beside 心, it portrays the heart wavering among possibilities, hence the senses of perplexity, doubt, and suspicion; the 或 element also supplies the on-reading waku."
