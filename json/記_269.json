  "explanation": "記 is a phono-semantic character. The element 已/己 functions as the phonetic, giving the on reading ki. The underlying image is that of a spool for winding thread, a form that stands behind 紀 (with 糸 “thread” plus 己), which originally meant to gather, wind, and store thread on a spool. From there the sense broadened to bringing things into proper order, and then to ordering one’s thoughts and committing them to writing. Applied to language, this becomes 記: to set words in order and write them down, that is, to record. The earlier sense of order remains visible in uses such as 紀綱, referring to the organizing framework or fundamental laws of a state."
