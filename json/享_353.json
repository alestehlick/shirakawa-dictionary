  "explanation": "In the old script this character depicts a building: above is a lookout like the top of 京, and below is a raised platform. Within that structure, 享 names the rites of honoring the ancestors; by extension it also means to inherit or take over those ritual observances from one’s forebears. Because the act centers on presenting offerings and reverent worship, it shares the on reading kyo with related ritual graphs: 饗 is the feast where lord and retainers drink together, while 享 refers more specifically to presenting offerings (kyosen) to the gods. From this ritual setting it further developed the sense of treating or entertaining."
