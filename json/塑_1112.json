  "explanation": "The original graph is 塑, a phono-semantic character with 土 “earth” indicating clay and 朔 as the phonetic giving the on-reading so; another early form writes it 嗉, using 素 as the phonetic, likewise read so. Beyond sound, 素 means “base, raw material,” and 朔 means “beginning,” which suits the idea of starting from a core. The word thus points to a figure modeled in clay—a puppet or effigy—built up by applying clay over a wooden core that serves as the model. Terms such as 泥塑人 refer to a human-shaped clay image, while 土偶 names one made entirely of clay. Tradition even tells that the Yin king Di Yi fashioned clay images of deities and took pleasure in debasing them, an anecdote that underscores the concrete, crafted sense carried by 塑."
