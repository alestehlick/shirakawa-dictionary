  "explanation": "A late phono-semantic formation, 湾 originally appears as the fuller form 灣, combining the water element with the phonetic 彎. 彎 supplies the sound wan and evokes a form bent like a drawn bow. By applying this image of curvature to water, the character came to denote a coastal recess where the sea bends inward—a bay or inlet. It is absent from the oldest character dictionaries and enters common use from the Six Dynasties period (third to sixth century) onward."
