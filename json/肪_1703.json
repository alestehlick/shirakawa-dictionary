  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character formed with the flesh radical (⺼) indicating bodily substance and 方 as the phonetic. 方 also carries the idea of things gathering in one place, as in 房 “tuft,” which suits fat as something that collects within the body. The Shuowen glosses it as “to grow fat,” and the character came to denote solid fat at ordinary temperature—a nutritive substance—seen in compounds like 脂肪. Expressions such as 肪膩 describe the soft, oily smoothness of skin suffused with fat, once regarded as a hallmark of feminine beauty."
