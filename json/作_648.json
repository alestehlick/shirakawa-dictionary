  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 作 as a phono-semantic graph built on 乍, which supplies the on-reading saku and preserves the core sense of making. The graph 乍 originally depicted bending tree branches to weave a fence or the like, and in oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions it refers to constructing a fortress wall or crafting a bronze vessel. 乍 was the original character; later, 作 was created to express deliberate making and agency (as in sakui). From the concrete act of making a particular object, the meaning broadened to encompass human activity in general—carrying out, setting in motion, causing, or accomplishing—hence compounds such as sakkō, “to arouse or promote.”"
