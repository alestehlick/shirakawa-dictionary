  "explanation": "逝 is a phono-semantic character: the movement radical 辶 signals the idea of going, while 折 serves as the phonetic, guiding the on reading sei (compare 誓). In the Shuowen it is glossed as “to go,” and in early usage it simply meant to proceed or to be present, as seen in classical citations such as the Book of Documents (Da Gao): 昔朕其逝, and in the Book of Poetry (Minor Odes, Xiao Bian), where it is used with the sense “to go/approach.” From this basic notion of moving on, it later became a respectful term for dying, and it can also be applied beyond persons, as in 逝水, “waters that flow away.”"
