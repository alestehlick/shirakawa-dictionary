  "explanation": "In the oldest forms, this character is built from 矢 “arrow” and 攴, the striking hand/rod. It pictures beating an arrow to straighten and true its shaft—carefully correcting what is bent so it will fly right. Shirakawa also connects the notion seen in 寅, a graph of two hands working with care, to this image of rectifying an arrow. From the act of setting the arrow to its proper form come the senses “to bring about a proper result,” “to follow or model oneself on what is correct,” and, by extension, “effect” and “efficacy.” Later standardized shapes replaced these older elements, which has tended to obscure the original picture of hands striking and straightening an arrow to make it work as it should."
