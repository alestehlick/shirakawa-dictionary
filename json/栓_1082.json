  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: the wood radical shows the material, while the phonetic 全 supplies the on reading sen. Early lexicons gloss it as a nail or wooden nail, with 丁 evoking the nail’s head. From this image it came to mean a wooden stopper shaped like a nail, used to seal the mouth of a narrow-necked vessel. When such a stopper has a fluke or hook, the form 今 appears; this element is seen, for example, in the original graph for “to drink” and in depictions of a wine vessel (酉) closed with a lid. In modern usage the sense extends to devices fitted to the end of pipes to open and shut the flow, as in 給水栓 (water faucet) and 消火栓 (fire hydrant)."
