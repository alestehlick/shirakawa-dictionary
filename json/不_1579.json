  "explanation": "Shirakawa traces 不 to a pictograph of a flower’s calyx and the stalk that bears the pistil. That original, botanical sense survives only faintly—occasionally glossed as “corolla” (hanabusa) or “calyx” (heta)—because very early the graph was pressed into service as a loan. In bronze inscriptions it often stands for 丕 (hi), and so can mean “very, greatly; big.” From oracle-bone times, however, it is also used as a loan sign for negation, which underlies the Japanese -zu and -shikarazu. Related graphs map the maturation of the fruit: 丕 shows the pistil of 不 beginning to swell; 否 depicts the portion of the pistil’s stalk that has become fruit; the element 咅 (read hai) represents a ripe fruit about to split; and 剖 shows that fruit being cut into two with a knife."
