  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 胴 as a phono-semantic character. The phonetic element 同 originally depicted a tubular wine vessel and thus suggested the idea of something shaped like a tube. Combined with the flesh radical 月, which marks a bodily part, the graph points to the body’s central cylinder—the torso (胴体). From this core sense it broadened to name the central, hollow section of things: the shell of a drum, the body of a shamisen or koto, and by extension the hull of a ship or the fuselage of an aircraft."
