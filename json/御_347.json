  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 御 as a phono-semantic graph. The character incorporates a phonetic element (卸), while its ancient forms depict a kneeling worshiper bowing in reverence before sacred objects—either a twisted bundle of threads (yō) or a mallet-like emblem (午/杵). These ritual tokens were thought to welcome descending deities and, by their numinous presence, repel misfortune. From this ritual scene arises the basic senses of “to meet (the gods)” and “to ward off,” which naturally extend to “to serve” the deities and thus “to use” or “to employ.” In time, the character came to be prefixed to words connected with persons of high rank (as in 御衣, imperial clothing), imparting honor. Because its Sino-Japanese reading coincided with that of 馭 “to handle or train a horse,” 御 could also substitute for that character and be used for the ideas of a horse and of driving or handling one. In Japanese it functions widely as an honorific prefix (on-, o-, mi-)."
