  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph with 兼 as its sound element, 嫌 draws its sense from the imagery behind 兼. The old form of 兼 shows two rice stalks (禾) grasped together, whereas 秉 depicts grasping a single stalk. Set against 兼’s two-at-once, the single stalk suggests something insufficient or not quite satisfactory. Characters built with 兼, such as 赚 and 歉, thus carry nuances of discontent or inadequacy. When that notion is applied to human relationships, it becomes 嫌: the feeling that someone or something does not measure up to one’s liking—hence, to dislike."
