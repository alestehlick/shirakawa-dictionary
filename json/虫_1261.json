  "explanation": "The character now written as 虫 stands in place of the older 蟲, which showed three instances of 虫 gathered together, evoking a swarm of small creatures. In the earliest forms, however, 虫 itself depicted a snake-like reptile—indeed even the pit viper—and belongs to the family of snake graphs: the snake sign can appear as 巳, and 它, showing a snake with a large head, is the original graph behind 蛇. Within this same sphere of imagery, 祀 points to the worship of a numinous natural deity, reflecting the sacred aura surrounding the snake sign. Shuowen glosses 虫 as the general name for 蟲. Thus, while 虫 began as a serpent pictograph, 蟲 named the multitude of small crawling things; in later usage the single 虫 replaced 蟲 as the common character for “insect.”"
