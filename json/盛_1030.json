  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the graph combines a vessel as the semantic element with 成 as the phonetic, giving the on reading sei. The Shuowen describes it as黍稷—millet—piled in a vessel for offering, which grounds the core sense “to heap up, to serve.” This serving is not limited to grain; it also extends to fine wine. The vessel element points specifically to a container used for presenting or filling offerings. In bronze ritual ware there were large containers, where abundant piles of offerings were set out to the deities; from this ritual image the character naturally developed the senses of “many,” “abundant,” and by extension “prosperous.”"
