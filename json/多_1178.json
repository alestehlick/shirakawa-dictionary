  "explanation": "A compound graph formed by 夕 plus 夕. Here 夕 is taken as the figure of meat; two such pieces heaped together evoke an abundance of meat. This image is echoed in the ritual graph 宜, where two 夕 are set above and below a 且 chopping board as offerings in a mausoleum, reinforcing the picture of plentiful sacrificial fare. From this ritual scene the character came to mean “many, much,” and by extension “to excel” and “to be left over, to exceed.” Related characters preserve facets of this sense of surplus or largeness: 侈 speaks of flaunting one’s abundance, 哆 depicts a mouth opened wide, and 移 shows grains (禾) with much meat (多) in a rite meant to shift misfortune elsewhere."
