  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 導 as a picto‑phonetic graph with 道 (dō) providing the sound. In bronze inscriptions the graph written as 道 combined 首 “head,” the movement element 辵, and 又 “hand”; that composite is the ancestor of 導. Here 辵 marks advancing, while 又—and later 寸, which also signified the hand—shows the hand at work. The scene depicts grasping the head of someone from another tribe while entering foreign territory, proceeding with exorcistic, purifying power to clear malign influences. From this rite, 導 came to mean the purified, exorcised way and, by extension, to lead or guide, while 道 settled into the sense of “road, way.” The term 導引, noted in the Shuowen, names a Daoist breath-guiding practice for prolonging life."
