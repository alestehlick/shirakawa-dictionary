  "explanation": "Shirakawa understands 潮 as a phono-semantic character: the water element provides the sense of water, while 朝 lends both sound and the image of daybreak. In ancient forms, 朝 depicts the sun appearing among grasses with the moon still lingering, the moment of morning; in some bronze inscriptions the moon is replaced by water, graphically evoking the ebb and flow of the tide at daybreak. Thus 潮 came to mean shio/ushio, the sea’s tide. The compound 潮汐 names the morning and evening tides, with 汐 designating the evening ebb and flow. The character’s very formation reflects a coastal culture intimately familiar with the sea’s regular rise and fall."
