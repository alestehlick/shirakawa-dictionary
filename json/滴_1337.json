  "explanation": "滴 is a phono-semantic character: the water element (氵) gives the sense of liquid, while the phonetic 商 (also written 啇) marks the on reading teki. In the same phonetic series, 摘 portrays plucking with the hand a fruit that has rounded at the flower’s calyx (蒂/蔕). By contrast, 滴 evokes a water drop that gathers into a rounded bead and falls, which underlies its uses for shizuku (drop), shitataru (to drip), and shitatari (dripping). Expressions like 滴滴 and 滴瀝 vividly depict the sound and state of drops pattering down."
