  "explanation": "In its earliest form, this character is a pictograph of childbirth: the thighs spread as a child emerges. From that vivid image it bore the sense umu, “to give birth,” and 免 originally wrote what is now distinguished as 娩 (ben, “to give birth”). Because two similar-looking graphs were taken to be the same, they eventually merged into the single character 免."
