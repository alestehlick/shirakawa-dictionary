  "explanation": "Originally written 溪 and also seen as 谿, this is a phono-semantic character: the water element marks a stream, while 奚 supplies the sound kei and subtly contributes a sense of something thinned or narrow—likely alluding to a men’s hairstyle in which the hair around the crown is shaved, with a thin central braid left to hang down. The graph thus names the narrow watercourse between mountains, a clear ravine or mountain stream. Because such waters were regarded as pure, water and streamside grasses from these valleys were offered in ritual; old writings even record presenting water plants gathered from the muddy pools along a mountain brook (澗溪) to the gods."
