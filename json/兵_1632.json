  "explanation": "兵 is a compound graph formed from 斤, the shape of an axe, and 廾, the two hands aligned. It pictures a person gripping an axe with both hands, and originally signified a weapon; from there it naturally came to mean the one who bears it—the soldier, the warrior—and, by extension, matters of war and fighting. A related form, 戒, shows both hands raising a 戈 halberd and conveys preparing for war and, further, admonition. Classical sentiment toward arms is reflected in Laozi, Chapter 31: “兵者不祥之器”—weapons are inauspicious tools."
