  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 越 as a phono-semantic compound: the movement element 走 combines with the phonetic 戉 (etsu), the form of a ritual broadax. In ancient practice, when people faced hazardous crossings, a consecrated axe served as a curse implement; by stepping over it, one drew its numinous power before setting out—an idea he also notes in the background of 往. With that ritual transfer of strength at its core, 越 comes to mean going on under the axe’s imbued power: to go over or beyond, to cross, to pass, and by extension to surpass or exceed."
