  "explanation": "A phono‑semantic character: the hand on the left shows the act, while the right side (易) supplies the sound. Shirakawa reads 易 as the image of a spiritually potent jade set upon a stand, its brilliance streaming downward. Bronze forms often depict hands lifting such a jade, for contact with its radiance was thought to quicken human vitality and stir the spirit (tamafuri). In bronze inscriptions it appears in phrases like 對揚王休, “to respond to the king’s favor,” reflecting the idea of answering a benefaction. From the scene of holding up the jade, the character naturally developed the senses “to raise” and “to rise.”"
