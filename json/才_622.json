  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 才 as a pictograph of a wooden signpost erected to mark and sanctify a spot. A horizontal bar is set at the top of the post, and to it is attached a sacred receptacle for covenant writings offered to the gods. By fixing this token, the place becomes ritually charged—much like the Japanese practice of enclosing a worship site with brushwood (shiba) to invite the descent of deities. In this light, 才 originally means “to be, to exist” as the presence within a consecrated space, and it stands as the early form of 在. Bronze inscriptions use 才 in this sense, as in phrases like “正月才,” meaning “it is New Year.” Later, by adding the head of a small broadax, the graph becomes 在, “to exist; to live,” and the compound 存在 thus evokes a sacred kind of being. When new tools were made, they were purified and marked with 才 as a protective sign, akin to a charm. Affixed to the blade of a halberd, this element also signals “beginning,” giving rise to characters such as 裁, 栽, and 載. The modern sense of “talent” reflects an ability thought to be present from the start—an inner endowment rooted in that original idea of consecrated presence."
