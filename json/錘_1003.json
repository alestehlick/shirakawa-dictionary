  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character with 垂 as its phonetic element (sui). 垂 depicts flowers or leaves hanging down and conveys the idea of suspension, which gives the sense of a hanging weight. Accordingly, 錘 denotes a weight, especially the metal plummet used on a balance, hence compounds such as 称錘 for a scale weight. In textile work it also names the 紡錘, the spindle: a slender iron rod inserted to rotate within a tube, twisting the thread as it is wound."
