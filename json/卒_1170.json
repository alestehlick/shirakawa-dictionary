  "explanation": "Shirakawa understands the character as the image of a garment’s neckline or hem repeatedly crossed and tied off. In funerary practice, the neckband of the deceased’s clothing was urgently laid one over the other and fastened, a sealing act thought to keep the soul from slipping out and to bar malign spirits from entering. From this motif of closure arise senses such as to die, to come to an end, to be exhausted, and finally; and because the tying is done abruptly after the last breath, the character also conveys suddenness, as in sotsuzen."
