  "explanation": "Composed from a person and a child with the diaper element 褓, this character evokes the swaddling cloth put on a newborn. In oracle-bone forms it depicts someone holding a just-born child wrapped in cloth, portraying the ritual of instilling the ancestors’ spirit into the infant and safeguarding it thereafter. Bronze inscriptions highlight the swaddling with a bent stroke, and another form replaces it with a jade jewel, a sign of numinous power. From this ceremonial act of bestowing and preserving the spirit, the graph came to mean to keep, preserve, protect, and even to help and bring a sense of ease."
