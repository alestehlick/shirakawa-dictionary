  "explanation": "A compound graph: in its earliest form, 器 depicts four 口 signs—ritual receptacles for covenant texts—arranged around a 犬, a dog offered as a purifying sacrifice. The picture thus signifies vessels purified for ceremonial use, and the word first referred to ritual and funerary vessels. From this it broadened to mean tools and instruments, and by extension a person’s capacity or ability. In later standard forms the central 犬 was replaced by 大, the figure of a person with outstretched limbs."
