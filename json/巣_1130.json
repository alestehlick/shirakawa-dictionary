  "explanation": "A pictograph showing a bird’s nest in a tree with the heads of three chicks lined up inside. From this image the character took the meaning “nest,” and by extension the verb “to build a nest” (sukuu). The sense of dwelling in a nest lies behind older expressions such as sokyo, “nest-dwelling,” for people living in trees, and sokutsu, “nest-cave,” originally for cave habitation and later for a hidden haunt of wrongdoers."
