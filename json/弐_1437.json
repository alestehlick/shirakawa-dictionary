  "explanation": "弐 is the modern form of 貳, a phono-semantic graph. In the ancient character, a halberd (戈) is applied to the inscription on a bronze ritual vessel, indicating the act of scraping and rewriting—altering the original text. From this image of making a second version came the senses “again” and “two,” and by extension “a duplicate copy.” In contemporary practice it survives as the formal numeral in sums such as 弐万円 to guard against tampering. It also appears in words that express going against what should stand—disobedience, divergence, or a divided heart—as in 弐過, 弐志, and 弐心."
