  "explanation": "A compound graph combining 大, the front-facing figure of a person with arms and legs outstretched, and 火, fire. It originally depicted a fire rite that drove away defilement and restored purity. From this purificatory sense, 赦 “pardon” adds 攴, the disciplining strike, to express cleansing from guilt and the granting of forgiveness; and related graphs evoke water purification as well, such as 攸 and 滌 “to wash,” since both fire and water could be used to exorcise pollution. In compounds like 赤子 (newborn; by extension, the people), 赤心 (an unfeigned, truthful heart), 赤地 (ground laid utterly bare), and 赤貧 (utter poverty), 赤 conveys the sense of being stripped bare—naked, plain, unvarnished. It also names the color red itself, with 丹 (cinnabar) and 朱 (vermilion) as particular shades of 赤."
