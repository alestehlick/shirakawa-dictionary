  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character with 末 as its phonetic, signaling the on-reading matsu. The element 末 also evokes the sense of “fine powder” (as in funmatsu), which underlies compounds like tomatsu “to paint over,” picturing powder being worked by the hands. From this comes the core sense of spreading or covering—painting, smearing, applying— and, by extension, the idea of effacing what lies beneath, hence “to erase.” The word matsugaku refers to a headband; a tradition tells that when the First Emperor of Qin encountered deities at sea, they all wore such bands."
