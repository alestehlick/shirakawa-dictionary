  "explanation": "江 is a phono-semantic character: the water element signals a body of water, while the phonetic 工 (kō) contributes the sound and, in Shirakawa’s view, evokes a gently arched, rainbow-like curve (as seen also in 虹). In Chinese usage, 河 was used for northern rivers and 江 for southern ones; the name 江 is already attested in the Book of Odes and the Book of Documents, and Qin bronze inscriptions refer to the 長江 simply as 江. This likely reflects the long-recognized sweeping curve of the Yangtze from its middle to lower reaches. Hence 江 came to mean “river,” and by extension the Yangtze itself. In Japanese it is also read e in words like irie, “inlet.”"
