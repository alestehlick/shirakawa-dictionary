  "explanation": "The character combines 子, child, with 系, a form showing hanging decorative strands. It portrays a child adorned with ritual tassels and serving as a katashiro, a substitute who stands in for the one being worshipped, in ancestral rites. Because a grandson acted as the personator for his paternal grandfather, the graph came to mean grandchild. As the Book of Rites (Ji Tong, Summary of Sacrifices) states: “In the way of sacrifice, the grandson serves as the personator of the grandfather.”"
