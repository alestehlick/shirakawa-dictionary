  "explanation": "爆 is a phono-semantic character: the fire radical indicates burning, while 暴 serves as the phonetic and carries an image that deepens the meaning. Shirakawa understands 暴 as depicting the carcass of an animal laid out under the sun, drying and breaking apart; the Shuowen also glosses it as “to scorch.” Together they convey something seared by intense heat and then scattered—hence the senses “to explode,” “to burst open,” and “to split.” This imagery lives on in cultural practice: from ancient times in China, loud reports were used to drive away malevolent spirits. Early firecrackers were simply fresh bamboo heated until it burst; later they became strings of small bamboo tubes packed with explosive mixtures, the 爆竹 that crackle with auspicious noise."
