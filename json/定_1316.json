  "explanation": "Formed as a compound of the roof radical and 正 meaning to set straight or align, 定 originally evokes fixing a building in its proper place and orientation. Classical glosses already connect it with 安, the calm of stability—the state of antei, when nothing is in extreme flux. In uses like teisho, it signifies being settled in one’s dwelling and content with where one abides, hence the choosing and setting of a site or direction. In laying out a capital, builders took bearings from the so‑called fixed star (also called the house‑building star), a reference used to measure and decide positions. From this core image of settling and setting straight, the meaning broadened to the general sense of deciding or determining."
