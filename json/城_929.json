  "explanation": "A picto-phonetic character: the right-hand element 成 supplies the sound and carries the idea of ritually “adorning” and pacifying a halberd, a gesture of exorcism and purification. The left side shows the earthen rampart and walls. Early forms sketch a fortress in plan, with watchtowers at the southern and northern sides. In this light, 城 denotes walls ritually purified and secured, and by extension the fortified enclosure and the castle within. It can also be used for the act of building or fortifying a castle."
