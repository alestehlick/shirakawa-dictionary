  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the water element combines with 由, which serves as the phonetic and points to the on reading. Shirakawa traces 由 back to an older form 卣, the image of a gourd-like vessel whose seeds have ripened and dissolved, leaving the rind hollow. From this association with ripened seeds that yield an expressed liquid, 油 came to denote the oil obtained from seeds—that is, vegetable oil. Because oily substances produce a sheen, the graph also developed the sense of an oily state and, by extension, gloss or luster. In contrast, 膏 and 脂 belong to animal fat."
