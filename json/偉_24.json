  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 偉 places the person element beside 韋, which serves as the phonetic and supplies the On reading i. In this phonetic series, 韋 carries a positive charge—connotations of excellence and goodness—clearly echoed by related graphs like 韙 and 韡 that evoke beauty, prosperity, and vigor. Although 韋 also belongs to a graphic lineage tied to animal hide or leather, 偉 shares that family background while turning the sense toward human qualities: it describes a person of outstanding stature, someone who excels and is admirable, as seen in compounds for eminent talent, great person, and imposing presence."
