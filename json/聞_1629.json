  "explanation": "聞 is a phono-semantic character: 門 functions as the on-reading indicator, while the core image centers on 耳, the ear. In oracle-bone script it depicts a large ear above a person stretching up on tiptoe, emphasizing the ear’s capacity to catch sound. People once believed the ear could receive the gods’ faint voices—hence 聖, the person able to hear divine revelation. Another early bone form shows a hand raised to the mouth, suggesting formal address to the Son of Heaven (以聞). In bronze inscriptions, an ear is paired with the ritual wine cup 爵, evoking offerings and prayer made to discern the gods’ will. By the Warring States period the graph settled as 聞 with 門 added as the phonetic. From the original notion of hearing the gods’ voice, the sense broadened to ordinary ‘hear, listen,’ and in compounds such as 聞望 and 声聞 it also came to mean ‘fame, honor.’"
