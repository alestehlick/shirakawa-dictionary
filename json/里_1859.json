  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 里 as a compound of 田 “field” and 士, with 士 understood as the original graph of 社, the shrine where a deity is worshipped. In origin, then, 里 named the place where the shrine to the field deity stood, and because people settled around that sacred center it came to mean the village (sato). In Japanese, sato still evokes a community organized around its tutelary earth-deity shrine, in harmony with the character’s earliest sense. The graph later broadened to denote an administrative unit and, by extension, a unit of distance; in derivatives such as 俚 it preserves the nuance of the countryside."
