  "explanation": "A pictograph of a bird, drawn with contour lines that show the whole creature in profile. It simply means “bird.” By contrast, 隹 depicts a bird in abbreviated strokes and denotes a short‑tailed bird, serving widely as the bird graph in compounds. In oracle‑bone and bronze inscriptions, 鳥 appears for sacred birds and even for an astral object called the Bird Star, showing its role in rites and worship. The character 鶏 (also written 鷄) evokes the cock through the onomatopoetic kei of its cry, suggesting that the chicken, too, was regarded as a sacred bird."
