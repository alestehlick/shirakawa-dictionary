  "explanation": "This character began as a pictograph of a cowry shell. In the oracle-bone and bronze scripts it is drawn as the shell itself. Cowries, brought from the southern seas, were coveted by the inland peoples of the Shang and Zhou realms: they served both as ritual implements of incantation and as treasured valuables. Shells were pierced, threaded, and bundled; the character 朋 depicts two strings of cowries bound together, and bronze inscriptions record grants such as “five pairs of shell strings,” “ten pairs,” and even “twenty pairs.” Before metal coinage became common, cowries functioned as currency, which is why many characters related to wealth and economic matters contain the 貝 element."
