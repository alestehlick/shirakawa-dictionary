  "explanation": "Originally, 弱 was drawn as two bows set side by side, evoking the lighter ceremonial bow—softer and less forceful than a war bow. The paired bows thus pictured a “weak bow,” and from this concrete image the character broadened to mean weakness in general and, by extension, inferiority. Because it shares the Sino-Japanese reading jaku with 若, it was also at times used to write the sense “young” as a phonetic borrowing."
