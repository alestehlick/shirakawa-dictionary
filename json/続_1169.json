  "explanation": "Originally written 續, this is a phono-semantic character: the thread radical 糸 signals the idea of strands and linking, while 賣 (later simplified as 売) functions as the phonetic that gives the on reading. The Shuowen glosses it as “to stretch out, run in a line,” evoking threads drawn out in succession. From this image it came to mean things that continue, are kept up, or are strung together in a row. In both sound and sense it stands close to 属 (zoku)."
