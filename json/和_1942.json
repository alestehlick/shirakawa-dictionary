  "explanation": "This character combines 禾 and 口. In early usage, 禾 is not merely ‘grain’ but the marker trees set up in rows at the gate of a military camp, the sign of a mustering place. Joined with 口, the mouth that issues commands, the graph evokes the order given at that gate to halt fighting and return to quiet. From this image it came to mean making peace and reconciliation, and by extension to soften, grow gentle, and become calm. The Doctrine of the Mean already praises 和 as “the way that reaches everywhere under heaven,” treating harmony as a supreme human virtue."
