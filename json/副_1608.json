  "explanation": "A phono-semantic compound: the element read fuku depicts a swollen-bellied vessel, evoking the idea of being filled, while the knife component indicates cutting. In ancient usage this pointed to dividing a full sacrificial offering—specifically tearing open the breast—into two portions. From this ritual apportionment arose the contrast of principal and secondary: the second share became the reserve that accompanies the main one. Hence the character’s senses of “secondary,” “assistant,” and by extension “copy,” “reserve,” and “to accompany/comply,” as seen in compounds like 正副 (principal and secondary) and 副本 (a copy of a book)."
