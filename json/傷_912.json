  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 傷 as a phono-semantic character: the person radical 亻 sets the sphere of human affairs, while the right-hand element 昜 serves as the phonetic and preserves the imagery of 易. In that older form, a sacred jade is set on a stand with its radiance streaming downward, evoking the tamafuri rite that stirs the spirit and enriches human vitality. 昜, however, shows that force being covered from above—an obstruction of the rite—and thus signifies a weakening or depletion of human energy. Joined to the person element, it describes a state in which a person’s vitality is impeded or harmed. From this it comes to mean not only bodily wounds but also injuries of the heart—hurt, aching, grief, and sorrow."
