  "explanation": "Shirakawa traces the character to the older form 姬, a compound of 女 “woman” and 臣, which in this context sketches the breasts. Adding this breast element to 女 portrays a woman who has reached physical maturity. In early Japanese, hime referred broadly to women as the counterpart to hiko for men, and only later narrowed to daughters of high nobility or the empress. He links this to 彦 (彥), where 文 denotes temporary red body painting and 彡 marks beauty, together indicating the decorative markings applied to a youth’s forehead at a coming‑of‑age rite—hence a young man who has become an adult. By parallel, 姫 likely also belonged to the sphere of female coming‑of‑age."
