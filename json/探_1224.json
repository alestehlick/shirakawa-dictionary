  "explanation": "探 is a phono-semantic character: the hand radical shows the act, while the phonetic 罙 supplies the sound and the image. In early forms 罙 depicts a light being lowered into a pit—fire used to look for something hidden. The same phonetic appears in 琛 (chin, “jewel”), marking the series. Thus 探 originally meant to hold up a light and search within a hole, and by extension came to mean seeking what is concealed: to feel one’s way, investigate, inquire, or pay a visit to ask. The Shuowen glosses it as “to take something distant,” capturing the idea of reaching out for what lies beyond immediate sight."
