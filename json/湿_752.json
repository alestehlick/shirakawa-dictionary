  "explanation": "Originally written 濕, the character combines the water element with a graph for ken: festoons of thread hung beneath a numinous jade, a ritual implement used to invite the gods and call forth their epiphany. This sense of divine manifestation resonates with 顕, which depicts worship and the appearing of a deity. Closely related is 隰, the sacred lowland where invocations are held—a place of descent and ascent for the divine. From naming the holy waterside where such rites were conducted, 湿 naturally developed the everyday meanings “to be damp” and “to moisten.”"
