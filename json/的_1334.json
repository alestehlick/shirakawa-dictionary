  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 的 as a phono-semantic character whose earliest form is 昀. Here 勺 functions as the phonetic element that signals the On reading teki, a value shared by other graphs built with 勺. Early lexica gloss it as “to become clear,” and the reduplicated form 昀昀 (tekiteki) describes a state of evident clarity; hence its use for meanings such as akiraka “clear” and hakkiri “distinctly.” 的 later became the prevailing written form of this graph. In subsequent usage it was also applied to the concrete sense of a shooting target, giving the kun reading mato and appearing in compounds like shateki “target practice.”"
