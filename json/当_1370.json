  "explanation": "Originally written 當, this is a phono‑semantic character with 尚 as its sound element; related graphs such as 堂 and 棠 also use 尚. Classical passages in the Xunzi show 当 used where 嘗 appears with senses like “once” and “as a trial.” Shirakawa understands 嘗 as the welcoming of deities who come in answer to offerings and prayers, and 尚 as the manifestation of those gods at the window where they are received. Reading 田 as the space between the fields, 當 evokes an agricultural rite of welcoming and worshipping the gods in the ricefield. Because such rites were performed at the proper season, the character came to express alignment with the right time—hence senses like hitting the mark, corresponding or meeting, fitting or suiting, being fulfilled, and “just now/exactly.”"
