  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character with 相 as its phonetic element, giving the on reading so. Shirakawa interprets 相 as a ritual scene: before the form of a thick, luxuriant tree, a spirit banner is waved, and by gazing upon it the viewer’s vital energy is enriched. Carried from this image of focused looking into human relations, 想 comes to mean turning the mind toward something—letting one’s thoughts travel far, thinking of home, and feeling for others. Hence its use in compounds like 想像 (calling to mind things not yet experienced), and later in more abstract notions such as 想念 and 思想."
