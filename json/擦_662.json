  "explanation": "擦 is a phono-semantic character formed with the hand radical indicating a manual action and 察 as the phonetic, which gives the on reading satsu. Shirakawa understands 察 as the act of sensing the gods’ will through ritual worship (祭), an encounter at the liminal edge where deities and humans come into contact. Carried over into 擦, that image of contact suggests the sound and feel of hands rubbing against each other, from which the meanings “to rub” and “to chafe” arise. The character is not attested in the oracle-bone or bronze inscriptions and comes into use only from the Song–Yuan period (10th–14th century)."
