  "explanation": "An indicative graph, 八 sketches a shape opened to left and right, evoking something split in two. In ancient counting-rod notation this sign denoted the number eight, and from the same image of parting it also came to suggest dividing or separating. The idea of bisecting is echoed in related graphs such as 半, which depicts an ox cut down the middle for sacrificial offering and thereby conveys “half” alongside the senses of dividing and parting."
