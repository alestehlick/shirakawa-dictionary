  "explanation": "This character combines the bird graph 隹 with the tree 木. In its ancient form it shows many birds alighting on a tree, vividly expressing the idea of gathering. Early bronze inscriptions, such as the Mao Gong Ding, already use 集 in contexts like the phrase “唯天將集厥命,” where it carries the sense of bringing things together to fruition, as when Heaven’s mandate is realized. Shirakawa further sees an echo of bird divination: affairs were decided by observing how flocks gathered and dispersed, so the graph came to suggest both the act of assembling and the settling or fulfillment of matters. In early texts 集 also interchanged with 就."
