  "explanation": "In its earliest, pictographic form, 免 portrays childbirth: the thighs opened with a child emerging, which gave the graph the sense “to give birth” (umu). From this original image, 免 stands as the source for 娩 (ben), the character used for childbirth. Because two very similar ancient forms came to be written alike, they eventually merged into the single character 免."
