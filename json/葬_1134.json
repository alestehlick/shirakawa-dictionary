  "explanation": "A compound character combining the grass element and the graph for death. The grass evokes the ancient practice of first setting out the corpse among vegetation, while 死 depicts a figure bowing in reverence before the bones of the dead, the ribs rising from the chest. In early custom, the body was exposed until the flesh weathered away; the cleaned bones were then gathered and interred—this secondary interment is what 葬 names. Hence terms like 複葬, referring to such multiple or secondary burial, and 殯 for the rite of placing the corpse in a plank-built shelter while awaiting that weathering."
