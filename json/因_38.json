  "explanation": "因 is built from the image of a mat combined with 大, the figure of a person with arms and legs outstretched. Together they depict a person lying or sleeping on a straw mat, so the character first meant a woven rush mat or sleeping mat. From the notion of something habitually used as one’s resting base, the sense broadened to “to depend on, rely on,” and from there to “basis, cause, reason.” The related character 茵 (in) denotes a cushion or mattress braided from grass, preserving the old mat imagery."
