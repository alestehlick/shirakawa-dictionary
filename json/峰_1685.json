  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the mountain radical sets the scene, while the phonetic 夆 gives the sound hou and carries a vivid image. 夆 itself fuses 夂, the trace of feet turning downward—“to descend”—with 丰, a spray or twig thrusting upward that in ancient rites marked the sacred tree where a deity would alight. Together they evoke divine descent upon a holy bough. Placed on a mountain, the graph points to the high crest bearing such spirit-trees—the place where gods come down—hence the sense of peak or summit. The Shuowen records the variant form 峯. The same phonetic runs through 逢, originally an encounter with something numinous, and 烽, the beacon fire lit in emergencies, confirming the sound value."
