  "explanation": "畜 combines 玄, the image of a twisted bundle of thread, with 田, a vessel holding dye. It originally depicts immersing the skein in a dye pot; as the color slowly deepens with prolonged soaking, the character comes to convey the ideas of heaping up, lingering, and storing away. From this core sense, the on reading chiku is used for “to store up,” kiku for “to raise, support” and “to keep,” and kyu in compounds that refer to domestic animals and livestock."
