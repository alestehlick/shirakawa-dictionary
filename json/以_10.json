  "explanation": "A pictograph ultimately tied to the plow. In the graph 耜 (suki, plow), the left element 耒 shows the handled, forked-topped plow, while the right element depicts the rounded cutting edge of its blade; that rounded edge appears in early forms as 巳, as 以, or as a triangular variant. In Shang–Zhou usage a form written as 台 was used for 以te (with, by means of) by adding the covenant vessel that held prayer texts to the plow sign, expressing the idea of using the plow after ritually purifying it to ward off harm such as insect damage. The vessel element was later omitted, yielding the present form 以. The same 台 form also served as a first-person pronoun (ware, I) in ancient texts."
