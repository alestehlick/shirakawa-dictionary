  "explanation": "尊 originally sketches a ritual scene. The element 酋 shows the fragrance rising (indicated by 八) from a wine cask 酉, while 廾 or 寸 represents hands. Together they depict presenting that wine vessel with both hands before the gods. In bronze inscriptions the cask is even set before the fu, the divine ladder by which deities ascend and descend. From this act of solemn offering—and from the practice of granting such a cask as a mark of rank—the character came to mean venerable, noble, and to honor or respect."
