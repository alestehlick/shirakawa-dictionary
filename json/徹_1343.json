  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: its phonetic element marks the on-reading tetsu, while early forms show a hand (te/yu) lifting a reki, a narrow-necked tripod kettle (鬲). In ritual, after worship the kettles were set out in orderly rows for the banquet; 徹 originally named the completion of that setting-out—arranging and finishing the display. By contrast, 撤 denotes withdrawing the kettles. From the idea of carrying something through to the end, the meaning broadened to go through, penetrate, and thoroughly pervade."
