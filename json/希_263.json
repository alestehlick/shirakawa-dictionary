  "explanation": "This character began as a pictograph of a loosely woven cloth. The upper element, 爻, sketches the crisscross of the weave, while the lower 巾 shows the cloth itself, likely hemp. From the image of an open, sparse fabric it came to mean “rare, few.” In later usage that sense was often written with 稀, and 希, by phonetic association with other ki-sounding graphs that express wanting, was adopted to write the idea of hoping or desiring."
