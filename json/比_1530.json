  "explanation": "This character is formed from two human figures, one turning to the right and one to the left, an image of people drawing close and standing together. The Shuowen glosses it as shitashimu, “to be intimate,” capturing the sense of friendly closeness; in the Analects phrase junzi zhou er bu bi, it points to intimacy narrowed into cliquishness. From the picture of two people aligned, the meaning readily extends to “line up,” “arrange,” and by extension “follow,” while in compounds such as hikaku it develops the abstract sense “to compare.” A related graph, 从, depicts figures aligned one behind the other and is the original form of 従, “to follow,” underscoring this lineage of meanings."
