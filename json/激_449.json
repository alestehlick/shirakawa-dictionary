  "explanation": "激 is a phono-semantic compound: water on the left gives the semantic field, while the right-side phonetic is 敫, which also appears in 檄 (“written proclamation”) and points to the on reading geki. Shirakawa parses 敫 as 白 added to 放. In bronze and oracle forms, 放 shows 方—a body hung crosswise—struck with 攴, the ritual beating used to drive away harmful spirits; 白 depicts the withered, rain-whitened skull. Together, 敫 pictures striking the hanged dead, a rite meant to rouse and incite the fierce energy of the spirit. From this core idea of stimulation that makes things fierce comes the sense of violence and intensity; with the water element attached, it becomes water that surges and lashes violently. By extension, 激 came to denote intensity and vehemence in general."
