  "explanation": "In the oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, this character shows deer antlers set out in a row. A deer's paired antlers were regarded as something strikingly beautiful, so the graph came to mean “beautiful, elegant.” From the same image arises the nuance of things standing in a row or side by side. The simple form 丽 is the original graph, later serving as the upper component of 麗. The related character 儷 preserves the sense of “to stand in a pair,” and in compounds such as 伉麗 it refers to a husband and wife."
