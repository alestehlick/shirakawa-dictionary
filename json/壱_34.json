  "explanation": "The original graph is 壹, a pictograph of a pot (tsubo) whose fermenting contents swell and fill the vessel. From this image of inward repletion—being filled up—it took on the sense of “entirely, completely.” A full pot counted as a single potful, and by extension the character came to signify a complete unit, “one.” Because 壱 (壹) and 一 share the same on reading, 壱 is often used in place of 一 in formal contexts to prevent tampering, since 一 can be easily altered into 二 or 三."
