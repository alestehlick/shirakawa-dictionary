  "explanation": "損 combines the hand radical (手) with 員, which here represents a round ding, the three-legged bronze vessel used in ritual feasts. The graph evokes a hand interfering with the ding—either reducing the offerings placed within it or even damaging the vessel itself, perhaps breaking a leg. From this image arise the senses of harming, injuring, diminishing, and losing. This imagery is echoed in the name of Confucius’s disciple Min Sun (閔損), whose courtesy name Zi Qian evokes lameness of the legs, reinforcing the notion of a tripod with a damaged leg."
