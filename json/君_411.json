  "explanation": "This character combines 尹 and 口. In early forms, 尹 shows a hand gripping a sacred cane used by ritual specialists to summon and invite the gods. The 口 here is not a mouth but a ritual receptacle—a covenant vessel into which petitions to the deities were placed. Together they depict the shamanic leader who, holding the divine cane and intoning prayers, could call down the gods. Because this religious chief also wielded communal authority, the graph came to denote the head of a clan and, in time, the hereditary ruler—the sovereign or lord, the kimi."
