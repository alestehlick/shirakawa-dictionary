  "explanation": "Originally a pictograph of a person seen in profile with the mouth open, exhaling a sorrowful breath. The 欠 element draws the open mouth and the act of breathing out, while the small strokes suggest the moisture at the lips. From this ‘lamenting breath’ image grows a line of related graphs: 咨 first meant to lament or sigh, and from it comes 諮, to consult or inquire; the drool that hangs from the mouth gives 涎, slobber, and drooling before sacrificial sheep meat yields 羨, envy. 次 itself, by loan, came to express ‘to follow’ and ‘next,’ and thus ‘order, sequence’ (shidai). Its occasional sense ‘to lodge, make camp’ likely reflects its use for the army’s halting place (shi), close in on-reading."
