  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats 咲 as a phono‑semantic graph whose older related form is 唉, combining the mouth 口 with 矣. He understands 矣 as the figure of a person lifting both hands in cheerful mirth, which also underlies the Go‑on reading shō. In antiquity the action itself was written with 笑, a pure pictograph: a female shaman raises both hands, her body arcing as she dances to entertain and pacify the gods—a form close to 若. Although there are no early examples of 咲, Japanese later adopted this graph for the native verb saku “to bloom.” Earlier expressions spoke of flowers “opening” (hana hiraku), and the choice of 咲 reflects a poetic comparison: a flower unfolding was likened to a person’s mouth opening in a smile, hence its use in words such as hana‑zaku."
