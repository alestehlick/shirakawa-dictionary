  "explanation": "侮 is a phono-semantic compound: the person element on the left (亻) marks a human act, while 每 on the right supplies the sound and guides the sense. 每 was originally a figure of a woman with bound hair and a fixed hair ornament, and it also serves as the phonetic in characters like 梅. Ancient glossaries gloss 侮 as to make light of, hence to despise or hold in contempt. Classical texts use it in this sense, as in the Book of Documents (Pan Geng): Do not insult the elders, and the Zuo Tradition: He did not despise the widowed."
