  "explanation": "This graph portrays a woman’s pelvis: the lower part is the figure of a woman (女), while the upper element (臼) depicts the pelvic bone. From this image it first signified the waist/hips and was the original form of 腰. Because the waist is the body’s pivotal hub, the character came to mean kaname—the essential point or pivot—and, by extension, the notion of bringing things under control and unifying them. In the same vein, joined with 領 (“head”) it forms 要領, the grasp of what is most essential. The graph was also used in place of 邀 to express meeting or inviting someone and the idea of requesting or seeking. In Japanese it is read iru, “to need,” as in okane ga iru, “money is needed.”"
