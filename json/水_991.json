  "explanation": "This character is a pictograph of water in motion: a strong central stream flanked by smaller currents on either side. In early scripts a broad river could be drawn as three flowing lines (the form that became 川), while 水 could also indicate a more modest flow. From this image come related forms: when such a small current freezes, adding two “ice” marks yields 冰/氷, meaning ice. As a component on the left of other characters, it appears as the three-dot water radical, sanzui."
