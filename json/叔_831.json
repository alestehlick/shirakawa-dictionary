  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 叔 as a ritual image: a hand (又) grasps a sacred broadax whose head—shaped like the upper element associated with 戚—gleams with a white, purifying light before the altar (示). From that vivid white shine came the senses of “white” and, by extension, “good,” as seen in 叔金, naming bright, pale metals such as silver or tin. Because its sound aligns with 少 (“few, young”), the character also came to be used for “junior, younger,” yielding usages like 年下 and the pairing 伯叔 for elder and younger brothers."
