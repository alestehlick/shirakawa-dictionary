  "explanation": "期 is a phono-semantic character with 其 as its phonetic. The graph 其 originally depicts a square dustpan (箕), and from its sense of something regular and of set dimensions comes the idea of a defined span. In early forms 期 appears with 月, and some variants add another sign, tying the meaning to calendrical cycles—the month or day marked by the movements of the moon and sun. Accordingly, 期 denotes a specific, fixed stretch of time and, by extension, an appointed date (as in terms like 期日 or 納期), and it can also express the idea of meeting or coming together at a set time."
