  "explanation": "淡 is a phono-semantic character: the water radical indicates a relation to liquids and taste, while the right-hand component 炎 serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on-yomi tan and seen likewise in 啖 and 痰. The Shuowen explains its original sense as a light or thin taste—the degree of depth or strength in flavor. From this core it broadened to mean light, slight, or pale in color or situation, and by extension simple or cleanly seasoned. It is also used in place of 澹 to describe water that gently sways and moves, giving rise to nuances of quiet movement and calm."
