  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats 汁 as a phono-semantic character: the water element signals “liquid,” while 十 functions as the phonetic, giving the on readings ju/shu. In early ritual usage it appears in the expression 汁献 (shuken), a fragrant alcoholic offering presented at festivals, so called because it was a blend of many ingredients, including aromatics used to perfume the liquor. From this ceremonial sense the word broadened to mean the juice or soup of any liquid, especially mixtures in which various substances are dissolved or combined."
