  "explanation": "The character is originally written 殼, formed from 吉 and 殳. Here 吉 depicts a cereal ear whose kernels have already been removed, while 殳 is a long striking implement, the cane-like pike that conveys the act of beating. Together they picture threshing—beating the ears to strip away the outer layers—so that what remains is only the husk or shell. The small element at the lower left can be read as fragments of the spent grain. From this scene the word takes the sense of husk, shell, crust, and chaff. When the grain radical 禾 is added to this base, it yields 穀, shifting the focus to the cereals themselves, full with grain."
