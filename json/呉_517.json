  "explanation": "In its early form, 呉 combines the sign later written as 矢—understood here as the figure of a dancer inclining the head—with a box-like ritual vessel for covenants, a container into which written prayers to the gods were placed. The whole depicts a person who dances in supplication while holding the petition vessel, a rite meant to delight the deities so that a request might be fulfilled; from this comes the sense of enjoying or taking delight. Expressions describing someone dancing with easy grace echo this scene. The character 娯 (娛), “to amuse,” builds on this, with 呉 serving as its original graphic core. In later usage, 呉 also became the name of the ancient region and state of Wu."
