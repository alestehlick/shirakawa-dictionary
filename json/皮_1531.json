  "explanation": "This character is a pictograph showing a hand (又) peeling off an animal’s skin. The Shuowen explains it as “a person tearing off an animal’s leather,” which captures its original sense. It stands in contrast to 革, the figure of a whole hide opened out and tanned. Together they form 皮革, leather, a crucial material in antiquity for clothing, armor, and equipment. From the concrete idea of animal hide, 皮 also came to denote the outward layer or face of things—the surface appearance—seen in compounds such as 皮相 and 皮肉."
