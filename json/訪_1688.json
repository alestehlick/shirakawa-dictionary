  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph, 訪 sets the speech idea alongside 方, which serves as the phonetic and carries the sense of being widespread or of the directions, guiding the on reading hou. Early glosses describe it as “to consult widely,” originally the act of seeking counsel from the gods of each place and conferring with clerics or elders. From this ritual inquiry into the divine will arose meanings such as asking after someone’s whereabouts and going to see them—hence “to visit.” The nuance in otozureru evokes the ancient belief that the gods would signal their presence with faint sounds, a gentle “visitation.” The character thus remembers the rites and festivals held to locate and approach the gods, and by extension the human act of calling on others."
