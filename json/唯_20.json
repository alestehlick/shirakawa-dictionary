  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 唯 as a ritual compound: 口 is not a mouth but a sai, the covenant receptacle into which prayers are placed, set before 隹, the pictograph of a small bird. In archaic forms the bird alone can appear. Because birds were taken as divine messengers and employed in bird divination, the graph came to mean the gods’ assent—“just so; agreed”—to what was asked, which underlies its adverbial sense “certainly” and, by extension, “only.” The reduplicated 唯唯 preserves a reverent “certainly,” akin to kashikomarimashita. Related characters echo this divinatory background: 進 records advancing with the gods’ permission after omens; 雇 depicts consulting the deity’s will at the household altar door 戸; 顧 expresses turning back in respectful regard for that will, with 頁 showing the head in ritual headdress; and 雖 adds 虫, an intrusive spirit, beneath the sai, turning a full assent into a qualified one, “although.” In literary openings, 惟 or 維 can also function as a solemn “this,” reflecting the same oracular tone."
