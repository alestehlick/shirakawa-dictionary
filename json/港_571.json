  "explanation": "港 is a phono-semantic compound. The right-hand element 巷 provides the sound (kou) and originally evoked a place where roads diverge, a street crossing. With the addition of the water classifier 氵 on the left, that image shifts from branching streets to branching waterways—a river that divides, especially near its mouth. Such a place naturally serves as a landing for boats, giving the character its sense of a port or haven."
