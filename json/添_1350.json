  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 添 takes 忝 as its phonetic, signaling the On reading ten, while the overall sense is that of adding or supplementing—putting an extra portion or item alongside what is already there. This meaning appears in compounds such as tenka (adding, appending), tensaku (improving a text by supplying what is lacking and removing excess), and tenpu (attaching a document). In native Japanese it is read sou/soeru with the sense of attaching or keeping close, as in tsukisou (to attend, escort) and yorisou (to draw near, nestle close)."
