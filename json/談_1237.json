  "explanation": "談 is a phono-semantic character: the speech element on the left signals words and utterance, while the right-side component 炎 serves as the phonetic, supplying the sound (as it does in 淡 and 啖) and guiding the on-reading. The Shuowen simply defines it as “to talk.” In usage it covers everyday, friendly chatting, as seen in compounds like 談笑 and 戯談, and it also came to evoke the refined philosophical exchanges celebrated in the Six Dynasties under the name 清談. In both sound and sense it stands close to 譚."
