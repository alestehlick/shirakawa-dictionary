  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 為 as a compound that joins 象, “elephant,” with a hand (shown as 又 or 爪). The hand is added to the tip of the elephant’s trunk, picturing the handling or employing of an elephant. From this vivid image arise the senses “to do, perform,” “to use,” and “to make,” and by extension “act, deed.” In the Shang period, elephants lived as far north as the Yangtze, and it is plausible that large building projects and palace complexes were carried out with their help; the many ivory relics that remain attest to their presence."
