  "explanation": "Originally written 數, the character combines 婁, which depicts a girl with her hair piled high, with 攴 (攵), the hand holding a stick that marks an action. The graph shows striking and breaking down that coiffure, disheveling the hair. As an act directed against a person, it yields the sense “to attack.” From the image of hair thrown into disorder—beyond orderly reckoning—arose the meanings “number” and “to count.” And because counting follows fixed patterns, the character also came to signify established rule or ordinance, and by extension an allotted fate, as seen in compounds such as 命数 and 暦数."
