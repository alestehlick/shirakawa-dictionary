  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 拍 as a phono-semantic graph: the hand element signals a manual action, while 白 serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading haku and at the same time imitating the sharp sound of two hands clapping. Classical sources such as the Shuowen and later lexica record this form and gloss it with actions like striking, knocking, and clapping the hands. In usage it can also stand in place of 搏, “to strike.”"
