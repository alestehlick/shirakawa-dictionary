  "explanation": "Shirakawa interprets 遠 as a phono-semantic compound: the movement sign 辵 (“to go”) is joined to the phonetic 袁 (en). He reads 袁 as a funerary image—a piece of jade hung at the neckband of a burial garment for a spirit‑invoking rite, with the sign 之, originally shaped like a footprint meaning “to go,” placed at the pillow to send the deceased on the journey to the other world. In later script the 之 element appears as 土. With 辵 added to this base, the character shows the act of going off to a distance, and so comes to mean “far, remote.”"
