  "explanation": "貢 is a phono-semantic character: 工 provides the on reading kō, while the graph as a whole conveys the act of formally presenting goods. The Shuowen glosses it as “to present,” specifically in the sense of offering up products as tribute. In practice this meant the delivery of items made by the “hundred crafts,” the work of artisans rendered as dues. The Zhou Rites describe these offerings as the Nine Tributes—ritual items, cloth and cloth-money dedicated to the gods, vessels, timber, goods and garments, banners, and other articles—everything fit to be ceremonially presented. Thus 貢 centers on paying tribute in tangible products."
