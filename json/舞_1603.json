  "explanation": "舞 is a compound graph of 無 and 舛. In its earliest form, 無 does not mean “nothing,” but depicts a person dancing, sleeves spread and adorned with decorative streamers. 舛 adds the image of feet turned outward, the stance of a dancer. Together they form the full figure of dance, giving the meanings mau and mai, “to dance.” Oracle-bone inscriptions frequently record the rain-invoking rite called 舞雩, reflecting the character’s origin in ceremonial dancing. From the idea of stirring the spirit through dance, it also appears in compounds such as 鼓舞, meaning to rouse or encourage."
