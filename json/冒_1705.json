  "explanation": "In its original form, 冒 combines a cap-shaped element (the headgear sign, graphically akin to 冃 and sometimes written like 月) with the eye 目. It pictures a deep cap pulled down so that only the eyes show, giving the sense of covering or putting something on the head. The Shuowen glosses it as “advance while covered,” evoking a warrior donning a helmet and pressing forward. From this image arises the meanings “to venture in spite of danger,” hence “to risk” and “to defy,” as reflected in compounds such as 冒険 (to brave danger), 冒死 (to risk death), 冒瀆 (to profane), and 冒犯 (to offend or violate)."
