  "explanation": "Originally written 輕, this is a phono-semantic compound: 車 “vehicle” plus the phonetic 巠, which also guides the on reading kei. In ancient form, 巠 depicts the warp on a loom spread out and pulled taut by a transverse bar—straight, tightly drawn threads. From that image of directness and tension arose nuances of lightness and quickness. Applied to 車, it described a cart that moved lightly and swiftly; the sense then generalized to “light” and “fast” more broadly. From “light” further grew the shades “handy, easy, readily done,” and, in judgments of conduct or taste, “vulgar, shabby.”"
