  "explanation": "Originally written 藏, this character is phono-semantic: 臧 supplies the sound. Shirakawa understands 臧 as built from 臣, a person serving the gods, and 戕, a ritual pike used in purification, lending an auspicious sense of “all right, proper” along with the reading. The 艸 “grass” in 藏 conjures the image of a person or goods hidden among grasses, which underlies its oldest literary use “to conceal.” From that image it naturally broadened to “to save up” and, by extension, “storehouse.”"
