  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: the water element on the left signals wetness, while the right component 斬 serves as the phonetic and also hints at the idea of orderly progression. In 斬, an axe (斤) cuts wood step by step to make a cart (車), implying a sequence of measured actions. Transferring that image to water, 漸 evokes moisture that seeps in and spreads little by little, hence meanings such as “to soak,” “to get wet,” and by extension “to advance” gradually. This leads to temporal uses like “gradually; at last,” as seen in compounds such as 漸次. The related character 暫 (“for a while”) likewise reflects time passing in gradual stages."
