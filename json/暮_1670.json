  "explanation": "This is a phono-semantic character formed on 莫, which supplies the on-yomi bo and depicts the sun sinking between blades of grass—a vivid image of day giving way to night. From that picture arose meanings such as “to grow dark,” “dusk,” and “late.” Although 莫 later came to be used as a negator (“not”), the addition of the sun element 日 made the twilight scene explicit and yielded the graph 暮. In Japanese it also developed the reading kurasu, extending the idea from the close of day to the way one conducts one’s life and makes a living."
