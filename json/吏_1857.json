  "explanation": "Shirakawa understands 吏 as a ritual term. The graph combines 史 with a streamer. In the oracle-bone tradition, 史 depicts a hand raising a branch to which a sai—a covenant receptacle for writings addressed to the gods—is attached, an image of venerating ancestral spirits. Related graphs unfold this scene: 使 fixes the sai to a great tree and goes out to worship mountains and rivers; 事 adds a streamer to that branch to mark a state ceremony at such sacred sites. 吏 designates the person who conducts these religious services. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, the forms of 事 and 吏 are essentially the same; only later did 吏 come to mean an office-holder—an official who governs and manages."
