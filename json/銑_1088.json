  "explanation": "This is a phono-semantic character built from the metal radical and 先 as the phonetic, which supplies the on reading sen. The Shuowen explains it as metal possessing a lustrous sheen, pointing to fine iron. In classical usage it also names the paired lower corners at the mouth of a bronze bell; the Zhou Rites (Kao Gong Ji), in the section on bell makers, notes that “the two corners of the bell’s opening are called 銑.” In later technical language it came to denote pig iron, the crude, impure iron that runs from the furnace and solidifies in molds."
