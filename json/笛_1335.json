  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the sound is carried by 由, the same phonetic seen in 迪 (teki), while the meaning points to hollowness. Originally 由 depicted a bottle gourd whose seeds had ripened and dissolved, leaving the interior empty. 笛 names an empty length of bamboo used as an instrument—a flute. Ancient lexica describe it as a seven-holed bamboo pipe (筩), a hollowed tube, and later writings liken it to the shakuhachi, a five-holed bamboo flute."
