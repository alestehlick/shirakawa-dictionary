  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 放 as a compound of 方 and 攴. In ancient form, 方 depicts a corpse hung from a transverse beam, erected at the border as an apotropaic charm, while 攴 means to strike. The graph thus shows the ritual striking of the suspended body to banish malign spirits. From this exorcistic act flow the senses of sending forth or emitting, driving away or thrusting aside, and by extension letting go, releasing, or separating—hence its later use in compounds for unrestrained, self-indulgent behavior. Related characters illuminate the same scene: 白 is the bleached skull; 敫 depicts beating the remaining skull; 敖 expresses rousing the spirit’s power to demand the expulsion of evil; 徼 and 邀 place the rite at the border or on the road, and 嗷 is the cry raised during it; adding 白 highlights the whiteness of the skull; and 檄 names a proclamation intended to stir people by the force of its writing. All trace back to the image of striking the suspended corpse to summon power and send it out against evil."
