  "explanation": "婚 is a phono-semantic character formed with 女, evoking the woman and by extension marriage, and 昏 as the phonetic, which supplies the on reading kon. The Shuowen notes that wedding rites commence at dusk, linking the character to evening through 昏. In bronze inscriptions the graph appears pictorial, depicting the act of drinking from a wine vessel—an image of the nuptial rite. Ancient Chinese weddings featured the ceremony of “three eatings and three pourings,” a sequence of shared cups comparable to Japan’s sansankudo, where bride and groom drink from three cups three times each. From these ritual associations, the character came to be used for ideas such as ‘match’ and ‘marriage.’"
