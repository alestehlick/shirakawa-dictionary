  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 虐 as a vivid pictograph of a tiger with its claws. In the oracle-bone forms, the upper part outlines the tiger’s upper body, while below are the prominently raised claws—originally drawn long and naturalistic, far more true to life than in the later standardized character. A related early form adds a human figure caught by those claws, expressing a person in peril; from this image arose the senses of oppression, tyrannizing, and merciless severity. He also notes that in antiquity tigers ranged both north and south in China, being called hu in the north and yutu in the south; the Japanese tora likely reflects a phonological shift from that southern name."
