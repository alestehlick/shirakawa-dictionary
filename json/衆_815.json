  "explanation": "This is a compound graph. In early forms it combines the sign for city walls—an enclosure—set above three human figures aligned in a row, vividly showing many people gathered within a settlement and thus giving the sense of “many.” To clarify the enclosure sign, compare 邑, which adds the side-view of a kneeling person (巴) to the same walled shape to depict people within the city and so mean “capital,” “city,” or “village.” In bronze inscriptions the enclosure is sometimes written as an eye (目), hinting at people being in view or under observation. From these images the character comes to mean a large number of people—the populace, the common folk."
