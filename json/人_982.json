  "explanation": "In its oldest forms, 人 is a side-view sketch of a standing human figure, the basic sign for the person and, by extension, humankind. Shirakawa traces a whole family of characters that stylize this same body in different attitudes: 大 shows a front view with arms and legs outstretched; a bent figure appears in 勺 viewed from the side; 匈, the ancient form of 胸, marks a chest adorned with ritual body drawings; 身 presents a pregnant figure with a swollen belly, while 包 and 孕 depict the embryo held within. In 光, a person (written with the variant 儿) bears a flame upon the head, and in 兄 a person carries a ritual “sai” vessel above. 企 captures someone on tiptoe, heels raised, seen from the side. All of these are transformations of the same archetypal human shape, reaffirming 人 as the elemental graphic of the person."
