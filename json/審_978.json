  "explanation": "Under the 宀 roof, which depicts the ancestral mausoleum, stands 番, here understood as born from a claw-like element shaped like 米 joined with a hand or palm. This combination evokes the sacrificial paw presented in the shrine. Because such offerings had to be flawless, the scene suggests the act of scrutinizing the paw for any injury or imperfection. From this ritual of exacting inspection, 審 comes to mean to examine thoroughly, to render things detailed and clear."
