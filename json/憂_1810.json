  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 憂 as a compound graph that brings together the original form 慕 with 夊, the sign of a backward footstep, and an element written 頁 that depicts a ceremonial headcloth—here the mourning badge worn on the head. The whole draws a picture of a mourner halted in grief, standing still and absorbed in lamentation with the insignia of mourning in place. From that image arise its senses of grieving, sorrow, worry, suffering, and mourning. Related graphs reflect the same scene: 優, with the person radical added, first evoked one devoted to mourning and grief and then, by extension, someone who reproduces that bearing in imitation; 寡 shows a person wearing the mourning badge while reverently lamenting before the numinous, and so came to mean a widow; 擾 portrays the loss of composure that sorrow brings. The character’s meanings thus grow from the solemn, motionless posture of ritual mourning."
