  "explanation": "Shirakawa traces this character to a healing rite of exorcism. In its older, fuller form 醫, the upper element 殴 is built from a sacred arrow with the power to repel malign forces and the implement for striking; it evokes beating the arrow while shouting invocations to drive out evil spirits, since illness was seen as their work. Because shamans (巫) performed such cures, an even earlier form combined 巫 with this striking element. As treatment later came to include purifying wounds with wine and using alcohol as a stimulant, the wine-jar sign 酉 was added beneath, yielding 醫. The simplified form 医 condenses this history: it shows the empowered arrow set within a concealed niche, the emblem of ritual exorcism as healing—a graph already attested from very early times."
