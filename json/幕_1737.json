  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 幕 takes 莫 as its sound element (baku). The Shuowen defines it as “a 帷 hung above,” that is, a canopy suspended overhead—a tent. By extension it also refers to the hanging silks used to partition interior spaces, the tobari curtain. In military contexts such curtains were carried with the army and served as the commander’s quarters, which is why the graph appears in terms for a general’s field camp and command, as in 幕営, 幕僚, and 幕府."
