  "explanation": "Bronze inscriptions already show 隣 as a compound of the left-hand boundary/ladder element and the right-hand 粦. In 粦, a large human figure (大) is set over splayed legs (舛), with dots marking fresh blood, depicting a crucified victim offered in sacrifice; by extension it evoked the eerie corpse-fire (onibi) that was believed to arise there. The left element is understood as the gods’ ladder by which deities ascend and descend. Placing a human offering before this divine ladder and letting the death-fire burn created a potent curse-barrier at the frontier with other tribes. Thus 隣 originally named a sacred boundary site guarded by such interdiction, and only later came to mean a neighboring place or being side by side. In this view, 隣 preserves the older form, while 鄰 is a later reshaping; adding the fire radical to 粦 gives 燐, the graph for the corpse-light."
