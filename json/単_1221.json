  "explanation": "The original form 單 is a pictograph of an oval shield topped with two feather ornaments; different tribes distinguished themselves by the patterns or adornments on their shields. From this shield, the graph 戦 arose by combining 單 with 戈, the pike, to show combat with shield and spear. As a military term, 單 denoted a single unit or troop—hence expressions like 三單 for three troops—and from that sense it broadened to mean the single or the one, as in being alone or one in number. In compounds it also came to express doing something to the utmost or exhausting one’s powers, and by extension the sense of the whole or entirety."
