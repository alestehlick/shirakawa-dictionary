  "explanation": "A pictograph of a tool, 工 first sketches the simple form of an implement. In bronze inscriptions it can look like a metalworking stand used in forging and hammering. Beyond the workshop, this implement also had a ritual role in cursing rites: the archaic form of 巫 shows a spirit medium holding such tools in both hands, and 左 depicts a hand gripping this implement to seek out where the gods are. Thus 工 embodies both the craftsman’s device and a sacred instrument of inquiry."
