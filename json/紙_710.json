  "explanation": "紙 is a phono-semantic character: the left-side 糸 “thread” is the classifier, pointing to a thing made from fibrous strands, while 氏 serves as the phonetic and gives the on-reading shi. The Shuowen glosses it as a “cotton mat,” evoking early papermaking in which teased fibers—old cotton, plant bark, and the like—were combed on a draining screen and spread into a sheet. An older graphic form used a cloth element, reflecting paper’s cloth-like sheet quality; later the thread radical made its fibrous nature explicit. Although tradition credits Cai Lun in the late Han with inventing paper, the name 紙 was already in use; his contribution was to refine the technique, producing the esteemed “Cai Hou” paper from bark, hemp, rags, and even worn fishing nets. After the Battle of Talas in 751, Chinese prisoners transmitted papermaking to the Arab world, from which the craft spread onward to Europe."
