  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 路 as a phono-semantic character. Its phonetic, 各, originally depicts the covenant casket (sai) that holds written petitions, used in rites to summon the gods to descend in answer to prayer. With 足, “foot/steps,” added, the whole points to the path along which the descending gods proceed—hence the Shuowen gloss “way.” He further links 道 to a ritually purified space empowered to expel malevolent forces, so 道路 is a roadway purified and protected by such ritual power. From this sacred origin comes the honorific use of 路 in compounds relating to the Son of Heaven or feudal lords, such as 路車 (a lord’s carriage) and 路寝 (a palace). Related graphs like 賂 and 輅 share the phonetic 各; 輅 in particular denotes the ruler’s carriage. In origin, then, 路 is the “way of divine descent,” later generalized to mean a road or route."
