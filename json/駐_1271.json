  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character formed with 馬 “horse” indicating the semantic field of movement and halting, and 主 as the phonetic. 主 serves as the on-reading indicator seen also in 柱 and 注; in its older form it depicts a candlestick with a flame on a tallow tray, and by extension, like a pillar, suggests something set firmly in place. The Shuowen glosses it as “a horse halting.” From the image of a horse standing still, the meaning broadened to staying or stopping in general, hence the senses of halting and being stationed."
