  "explanation": "漁 is a phono-semantic character: the water element sets the scene, while the fish component serves as the phonetic (gyo). Ancient forms vividly portray the act of taking fish—some show a fish seized by the hand (又), others add a net (罔) with a hand to indicate net-fishing, and another variant places fish in water (水) grasped with both hands. From these images comes the meaning sunadoru: to fish, to gather fish and shellfish. Early Zhou bronze inscriptions record the offering of fish in ancestral temples, a practice also celebrated in the Book of Odes; at times even the king went out by boat to fish for that ritual purpose."
