  "explanation": "燥 is a phono-semantic character. The on-reading sō is signaled by a phonetic element that depicts many 口—sai, covenant vessels for written prayers—affixed to a tree as offerings while voices are lifted in prayer. With the fire radical added, this scene is taken allegorically to express drying and scorching by fire. The Shuowen glosses it as “to dry (up).” The sense later extends to human feelings, as in 焦燥 (shoso), ‘fretfulness.’"
