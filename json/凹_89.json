  "explanation": "A straightforward pictograph, 凹 shows a figure whose center sinks below its sides, and so it came to express concavity: both the act of becoming hollow and the hollow or cavity itself. In contrast, 凸 depicts a center that swells upward. These two are almost emblematic signs, their shapes directly signaling the ideas of concave and convex."
