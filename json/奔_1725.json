  "explanation": "奔 is a compound graph that intensifies the image found in 走. The upper element is the same as in 走: a person leaning slightly forward, arms swinging as they run. The component 止 represents footprints, the act of going. By setting three 止 beneath that running figure, the character heightens the sense of movement and urgency—more emphatic than 走, which adds only a single 止. Hence 奔 came to mean running swiftly or dashing about. The compound 奔走 originally evoked the busy scurrying performed during rites of worship, and by extension came to mean bustling around or rushing about."
