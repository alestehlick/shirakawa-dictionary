  "explanation": "In the earliest forms, 前 is a compound that brings together a footprint (止), a shallow vessel (舟, also written as 月) used as a basin, and a knife (刀). It pictures washing the feet in a basin and then trimming the toenails to an even line—an act of ritual purification performed before setting out on a journey or upon returning home. From this idea of preparation prior to setting forth, the character came to mean “to advance” and “before, in front.” It also became the base for related graphs: with an added knife it formed 剪, “to cut,” and with the hand added it gave 揃, “to cut and set in order.” By extension, 前 naturally came to mark what is “earlier” or “formerly” in time."
