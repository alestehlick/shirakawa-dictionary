  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character. In the ancient graph, a piece of jade is shown fastened at the neckband of a shrouded body, with an eye drawn above as a sign of life. This depicts a rite that petitioned for the dead to return to life, and 環 originally named the jade employed in that ceremony. From this ritual object arose the senses of bead and ring, and, by extension from its round shape, the idea of a circle or circuit."
