  "explanation": "Originally written 戀, this is a phono-semantic character: the heart component gives the sense of feeling, while the phonetic is allied to 攣 (ren), a graph meaning to draw together or bend, which supplies the sound and evokes a heart pulled toward someone. Early literature already uses it for tender remembrance, as in the Han Shu, and old annotations even note that 攣 can be read as 戀, glossing it as the heart being attracted—to love and to yearn. From this, the character came to express love and longing."
