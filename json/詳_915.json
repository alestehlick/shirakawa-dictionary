  "explanation": "詳 is a phono-semantic character formed with 言, “speech,” and 羊 as the phonetic element that gives the on reading sho; the same phonetic appears in 庠 and 祥. The Shuowen glosses it as “to consult in detail,” hence the senses “detailed” and “thorough.” Shirakawa links 羊 to an ancient sheep trial by ordeal in which each party offered a sheep and their statements were carefully heard; within that ritual context, 羊 came to suggest exhaustive inquiry and attentive hearing. Combined with 言, the character thus conveys speech examined and weighed with care—setting matters out, or inquiring into them, in full detail."
