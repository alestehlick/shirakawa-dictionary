  "explanation": "酒 is a phono-semantic character: the water radical on the left marks a liquid, while the right side, 酉, originally depicts a wine cask and by itself once meant “sake.” Related graphs illuminate its ritual setting. 酋 adds the sign 八 above the cask to show the alcoholic vapors rising—“old, well-matured sake.” 尊 shows the wine cask being held with both hands and set before the gods, and 樽 names the wooden cask itself. In the Yin and Zhou periods, bronze ritual vessels were often wine vessels, and inscriptions frequently record 作寶尊彝, “to make a precious revered ritual vessel,” underscoring wine’s central place in sacrificial rites; tradition even held that the Yin dynasty later fell through excess in drink."
