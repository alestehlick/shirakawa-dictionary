  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character formed from 門, which speaks of a house or lineage, and the phonetic 伐 (batsu). In early military usage, 伐 in phrases such as 伐旌 referred to the public recognition and awarding of martial exploits. An older related form, written with a graph akin to 蔑, evoked the ritual capture and killing of enemy priestesses to dispel their curse power—hence that graph’s later sense of “to despise.” In 閥, however, 伐 contributes its sound and the notion of “merit, exploit,” while 門 anchors the meaning in “house” and “lineage.” The character thus came to denote a house distinguished by military merit—renowned lineage, a powerful family—and by extension the circles of influence known as cliques or factions, as in monbatsu, gakubatsu, zaibatsu, and habatsu."
