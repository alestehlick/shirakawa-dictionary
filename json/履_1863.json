  "explanation": "Shirakawa analyzes 履 as a composite showing ritual footwear and movement. The graph brings together 尸, a katashiro—an effigy standing in for an ancestral spirit at rites—alongside 彳, the “go, walk” element from the crossroads graph 行, and 夊, the form of feet in motion. The component 舟 here does not mean “boat” but depicts the scooped, hollowed shape of ceremonial footwear. From this image of putting on shoes for formal occasions such as funerals and then setting out, the character came to mean to don footwear and, by extension, to proceed to carry out what has been declared—hence its use in compounds like 履行, “to fulfill, to execute.”"
