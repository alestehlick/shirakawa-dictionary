  "explanation": "隅 is a phono-semantic character. The right component 禺 supplies the sound and depicts a crouching animal-like figure with an enlarged head—an uncanny image akin to clay or wooden effigies that inspired awe and fear. The left component 阝 (from 阜) is understood as the divine ladder by which gods descend and ascend. Placing the numinous figure of 禺 on this sacred ladder marks a spot set apart and not to be approached. From this sense of a sanctified, withdrawn place arose the meanings of a corner or nook—hidden recesses where paths or rivers turn in—and, by extension, angles and edges."
