  "explanation": "週 is a phono-semantic compound: the walking/path element 辵 supplies the idea of movement, while the phonetic 周 gives the sound. 周 itself depicts the face of a square shield divided by a cross into quarters with ornamented panels—an emblem associated with the Zhou clan. In warfare, a covenant vessel was set beneath such a shield and prayers for victory were recited, underscoring 周’s ritual aura. With 周 providing the sound shuu and 辵 the meaning “to go,” 週 came to mean making a circuit or going around, and by extension the regular return of days in a fixed cycle—hence the “week,” set as a cycle of seven days."
