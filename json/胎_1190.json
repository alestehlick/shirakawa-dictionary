  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the left-side 月 (nikuzuki) marks a part of the human body, while 台 serves as the phonetic and evokes a ritual scene. In that rite, a plow (ム) was purified and, together with a covenant vessel (sai) that held written prayers to the gods, offered in supplication for a rich harvest. Human birth was imagined in parallel with the sprouting of crops, so the same purification and offering were performed when praying for conception (jutai). From this association, 胎 came to mean to become pregnant and the womb itself. Relatedly, 始 depicts a woman’s prayer for safe delivery with the plow and covenant vessel, and an ode in the Book of Odes on gathering plantain—an herb auspicious for childbearing—preserves the compound 胚胎, “gestation.”"
