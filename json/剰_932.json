  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats 剰 as a later phono-semantic graph, originally written 剩, with 乘 (modern 乗) providing the sound value jo. He connects it to 賸, whose composition portrays an offering: a shallow tray (the element written 月 here is taken as the form of a tray or vessel) bearing shell money 貝, held up with both hands. From this scene arise the senses of presenting or giving, and by extension what is left as a remainder. In use, 剰 expresses “to be left over,” and in adverbial form 剰え (amatsusae) conveys “what is more; besides.”"
