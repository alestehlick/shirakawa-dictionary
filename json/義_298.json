  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 義 as a compound of sheep (羊) and the sign 我, which originally depicts a saw. In ancient rites, sheep—favored as offerings—were cut in half with a saw so that the sacrifice could be shown flawless inside and out: not only the fleece, horns, and hooves, but even the inner organs free of any defect. From this ideal of a sacrifice wholly fit before the gods, 義 first meant what is correct as an offering and later broadened to what is right and proper in general. The right side of 犠 in 犠牲 preserves this image as 羲, showing the lower legs of the sawn sacrificial sheep hanging down; with the cattle element added, 犠 extends the notion to sacrifices including oxen and other animals."
