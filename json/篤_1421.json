  "explanation": "篤 is a compound of the bamboo sign and a horse. Here the bamboo element is an abbreviated form of 竺, which classical glosses equate with 厚, “thick, cordial,” and which also carried the sense of 毒, “poison.” When this idea is applied to a horse (馬), the character first evoked a horse stricken by poison, suggesting a condition of gravity and seriousness. From that core arose the positive sense of deep warmth and sincerity, seen in compounds like 篤学 (earnest study), 篤行 (sincere conduct), and 篤実 (true-heartedness). In later usage the notion of seriousness developed specifically in the medical sphere, yielding terms such as 篤疾 (severe illness) and 危篤 (critical condition)."
