  "explanation": "神 is a phono-semantic character. Its phonetic, 申, originally pictured a flash of lightning, and because a lightning bolt was felt as the sudden manifestation of divine authority, 申 itself was used in bronze inscriptions with the meaning of “kami” and was the original graph for this idea. When 申 later came to be used for the polite verb “to say,” the altar sign 示 was added to fix the older religious sense, yielding 神. Many characters built with 示 (the altar) belong to this sacred sphere, such as 社, 祠, and 祖. In early usage 神 referred to nature deities and the veneration of natural forces and things; bronze texts also show ancestral spirits coming to be revered as gods. In later extensions it could denote the heart and its workings, or a person of outstanding mental powers."
