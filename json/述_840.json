  "explanation": "In the ancient graph, 述 combines 辵, the sign of going along a road, with 朮, depicted as a spirit-charged animal used in divination. On campaign, such divination determined whether an army should advance or withdraw, and 述 names the act of proceeding in accordance with that verdict—thus, to follow what has been revealed. Related graphs include 遂, which expresses carrying on once the omen’s result is known, and 術, the practice of such divination performed on the road. From this core notion of following and transmitting a decided course, 述 came to mean passing on what has been handed down, as in the Analects’ 述而不作, “I transmit and do not create,” and hence the later, common sense “to state, to relate.”"
