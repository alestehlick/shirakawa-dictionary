  "explanation": "This character portrays a rounded clod of clay set upon a stand—an image of the clay itself shaped into an oval, echinus-like form and revered as the deity of the soil. Oracle-bone inscriptions show libations of purifying liquor being poured over this earthen god as people prayed. Places where such soil deities were enshrined were called yashiro (shrines), so 土 functioned as the prototype of 社, with 示 added to indicate the sacred altar. From denoting the consecrated earthen effigy, the graph naturally broadened to mean soil, a lump of earth, and the solid ground itself."
