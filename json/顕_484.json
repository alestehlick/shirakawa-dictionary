  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads the original form 顯 as a ritual tableau. The graph combines 頁, a person seen in profile wearing ceremonial headgear and bowing, with an element that depicts a spirit-charged jade—drawn like the “sun” graph but here understood as sacred jade—beneath which hang fine tasselled bundles (likened to split white hemp). This was a device used as the dwelling place and invitation token for a departed soul or a deity. The whole shows a worshipper bowing before the spirit-jade to call the god down; in response the spirit stands forth and appears in the present world. From this image the character comes to mean to appear, to be manifest and clear, openly visible and conspicuous. The later character 現 was created as a phono-semantic counterpart modeled on 顕."
