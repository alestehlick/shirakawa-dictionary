  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the hand element 扌 anchors the sense in manual action, while 出 serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on reading setsu (via the sound of shutsu). The Shuowen glosses it as 'not skillful' and sets it in deliberate contrast to 巧 'skillful,' so 拙 came to mean clumsy, unskillful, inept, or inopportune. Classical thought, however, found dignity in such plainness: Laozi 45 says that great craft looks like clumsiness, praising those who do not flaunt cleverness. From this emerges the cultivated ideal 守拙, 'to keep one's clumsiness,' a refined way of life that values unadorned simplicity over showy craft."
