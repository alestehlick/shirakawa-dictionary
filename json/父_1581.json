  "explanation": "This character combines the form of a broadaxe head with the hand 又. The axe here is not a woodcutter’s tool but a ceremonial broadaxe, an emblem of command. The graph shows a hand gripping the axe-head, and so depicts a person vested with authority. From this, it came to mean the father—the one who directs the household—and, by extension, a respectful title for a distinguished man, as when Duke Ai mourned Confucius as “Ni-fu” (Father Ni) in Zuo’s Commentary. Related signs share this axe symbolism: 王 portrays a large broadaxe set down as a royal insignia, and 士 a smaller axe head for a warrior’s rank. In this system, 斧 and 鉞 mark status, and 斤 is the axe borne by the figure represented in 父."
