  "explanation": "倫 is a phono-semantic character built from the person radical and 侖 as the phonetic. The element 侖 (rin) supplies the sound and evokes the sense of parts cohering into a whole—just as in 輪 (wheel). From this, 倫 depicts people in relation: companions, fellows, and one’s kind, and by extension the categories or sorts to which they belong. In compounds like 人倫 (jinrin), it denotes the human way—the proper order and conduct among people—hence the meanings of ethics and morality."
