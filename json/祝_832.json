  "explanation": "This character combines 示, the altar used in divine worship, with 兄, which originally portrayed a person bearing on the head a ritual container called a sai—a covenant receptacle that held written petitions to the deities. In early society the eldest brother oversaw such rites. The graph thus depicts worship performed before the altar and came to mean to pray, and by extension a person who conducts those rites—the hafuri, a ritualist or Shinto priest. In later usage it broadened to the joyful sense of celebrating and offering congratulations."
