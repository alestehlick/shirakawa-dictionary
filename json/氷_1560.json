  "explanation": "This is a pictograph of congealed ice. The earliest shape simply depicted ice itself; with the later addition of the water element, the form became 氷. Bronze inscriptions also write it as 冰, where 水 sketches a small stream of flowing water and the paired strokes beside it represent clumps of ice adhering across the flow—an image grounded in how narrow runs of water freeze easily. From this picture the character comes to mean “ice,” and by extension “to freeze” and “cold.”"
