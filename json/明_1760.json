  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 明 as a compound graph that originally set the window pictograph 囧 beside the moon 月. It pictures moonlight entering through a window—an image grounded in the semi‑subterranean houses of the loess regions of ancient northern China, where a shaft-like room with a single opening admitted light that was revered as the presence of the divine. From this, the character takes on senses of light and brightness, clarity, dawning or opening, and revealing; hence the compound 神明 (shinmei) denotes the gods."
