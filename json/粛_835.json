  "explanation": "Originally written as 肅, this graph combines 聿, a writing brush, with the ancient pictograph for 規, the compass used to draw circles. It evokes the act of first laying down a precise outline with a compass and then completing it with the brush by adding fine decorative patterns. Related characters illustrate the same idea of patterned adornment: 畫 (画) shows ornamenting a square shield, and 繡 refers to embroidery, fabric enriched with minute designs. In ritual contexts such careful decoration served to sanctify an object, and from that sense the character came to express restrained, respectful conduct and, by extension, the disciplined rectification reflected in later usages."
