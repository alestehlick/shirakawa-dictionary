  "explanation": "A phono-semantic compound: the phonetic element read man depicts a ceremonial lap-robe (heishitsu) richly embroidered on one side; because the embroidery covers the whole surface, it conveys the idea of being completely adorned—filled with decoration. With the three-stroke water element added, the graph 滿/満 pictures water so abundant it brims over, giving the sense “full (of water).” From there it broadens to the general meanings “to be full,” “to fill,” and “to suffice.” The same man element appears in 瞞, where, combined with the “eye,” it evokes eyes led astray by profuse ornament, hence the notion of deception, as in 欺瞞."
