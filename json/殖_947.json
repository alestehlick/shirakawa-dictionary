  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: the left component 歹 depicts the remaining bones of a corpse from the chest upward, while 直 serves as the phonetic, yielding the on-yomi shoku, as also seen in characters like 植 and 埴. Although the base image involves decay, it points to the bones turning to powder—bone ash valued as fertilizer—which in turn nourishes life. From this idea that what decays fosters new growth, the character comes to mean to increase, multiply, and grow luxuriantly, reflected in readings such as fueru, fuyasu, and shigeru."
