  "explanation": "In its earliest forms, 事 is a compound built on 史 with an added streamer. The graph 史 shows a hand raising a wooden staff to which a ritual container (sai) for covenant texts is attached, used in venerating ancestral spirits. From this, 使 depicts that sacred apparatus fixed to a great branch and carried out among the provinces to worship mountains and rivers. With 事, a streamer is affixed to the great branch to mark the holding of national rites, so the character first meant worship or festival. Phrases such as 大事 “great rite” and 王事 “the king’s rite” reflect this, and oracle-bone inscriptions often ask, “Shall the king’s rite be performed?” Receiving envoys from the Yin king and performing these rites signaled submission to royal authority. From this cultic base the meaning broadened to administration and affairs of state, then further to general affairs or things, and also the notion of serving under authority."
