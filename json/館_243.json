  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character built from the food radical on the left and the phonetic 官 on the right. Shirakawa explains 官 as the figure of a sacred quarters where the “worship meat” for the army’s shrine was kept—meat offerings that were carried when the army set out and enshrined in a building when it encamped. Thus 官 originally indicated a consecrated building and, by extension, the residence of commanding generals. With the addition of the food element, 館 drew on that idea of an official, housed place to denote the generals’ lodge and, more broadly, halls and mansions used for public ceremonies. The meaning later widened to institutional buildings—governmental and diplomatic offices, schools—and in modern usage appears in names such as ryokan (旅館, an inn) and eigakan (映画館, a cinema)."
