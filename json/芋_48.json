  "explanation": "芋 is a phono-semantic character: the grass/plant sign marks it as a plant, while 于 serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on-reading u and evoking something long and large with a softly curved tip. The whole thus names the potato-like tuber, conceived as thick and elongated. A related character for potatoes is 藷 (薯) read sho, which incorporates 者 with the sense seen in takuwaeru, “to store up,” suggesting a rounded, substantial form; it refers to tubers that store abundant nutrients in their roots."
