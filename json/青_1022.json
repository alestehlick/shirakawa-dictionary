  "explanation": "Originally written as 靑, this is a phono-semantic character. In bronze inscriptions the upper element is 生, which serves as the phonetic that yields the on reading sei and also depicts a sprouting plant, evoking the fresh blue-green of young growth. The lower element 丹 portrays a pit or well for gathering cinnabar, the mineral earth used as a base for pigments. Ancient sources list many such mineral colors—white cinnabar, blue cinnabar (青丹), vermilion earth (丹雅), and blue earth (青曠)—and blue colorants were prepared from this cinnabar-bearing soil. Like 朱 (vermilion), which derives from mercuric sulfide, 青 names a mineral color thought not to fade and thus suited to consecratory uses. From these associations the graph came to signify the clear, enduring hues we call blue and green."
