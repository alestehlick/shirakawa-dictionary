  "explanation": "A pictograph of an animal that bends its tail and crouches. The graph centers on 尸, depicting the upper half of the animal’s body; in older forms a long, furry tail is clearly drawn below. The element 出 represents the footprint form 止 with a curved stroke indicating the heel. Together they show a creature lowering itself with its tail tucked, hence the senses “stoop, crouch” and, by extension, “bend.” Because a tucked tail signals willing submission and obedience, the character also came to mean “yield” or “submit.” This image lives on in words such as 窟, “cave,” conceived as the dwelling of such an animal, and in 窮屈, “cramped,” evoking the confined posture of life in a rock cave."
