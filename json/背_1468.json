  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character. The old form of 北 depicts two people set back to back, one facing right and the other left—an image that naturally yielded the sense of the back. When 北 later specialized as the directional “north,” the flesh element 月 (nikuzuki), marking a body part, was added to create 背 and anchor the meaning as “back, backside.” 北 also serves as the phonetic, as seen in the place-name graph 邶, and it gives 背 the on reading hai. From the scene of turning one’s back arose extended senses such as to turn away, oppose, or betray. In Japanese usage it also points to stature (se, sei), as in setake and seikurabe."
