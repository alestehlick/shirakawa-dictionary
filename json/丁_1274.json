  "explanation": "In the oracle-bone and bronze scripts, 丁 draws the flat, plan view of a nail’s head, making it a straightforward pictograph; from this original graph later came 釘 (nail). The character also names the fourth of the Ten Heavenly Stems, known as hinoto, the “junior Fire.” By extension it came to mean a young adult, as seen in 丁壮 and 丁年. In Japanese usage the reading chō in terms like 丁数 and 落丁 reflects an association with 帖 (a leaf or document), and in addresses such as 二丁目 it designates a numbered town block."
