  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 許 as a phono-semantic character: 言 represents the words or prayers offered, while 午 serves as the phonetic element. In archaic forms the graph later written as 午 did not mean “noon,” but depicted a twisted ritual bundle (yo), a fetish believed to hold spiritual power; it was later stylized like a mallet (kine). This sacred implement was set up and venerated, prayers were addressed to it, and the deity was invoked to descend, accept, and grant them. Thus 許 first expressed the gods’ granting of a petition—permission—and only later broadened to the general senses of permitting, admitting, or allowing. The phonetic value of 午 also resonates with the reading of 御 (gyo), an older graph written with the same element, which helps account for the on reading."
