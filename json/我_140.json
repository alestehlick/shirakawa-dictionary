  "explanation": "In origin, 我 depicts a saw with a notched blade. Personal pronouns had no dedicated way to be written, so the graph was later borrowed phonetically to represent the first-person pronoun ware. To restore the concrete meaning of saw, the picto-phonetic character 鋸 was formed by adding the metal radical to 我. The identification of 我 as a saw is supported by related graphs such as 義 and 羲, which portray a sheep being cut with a saw for sacrificial offering: 義 shows the act of offering the sheep to the gods, while 羲 shows the remaining hind legs of the sacrificial animal hanging down."
