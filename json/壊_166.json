  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 壊 as a picto‑phonetic character whose traditional form is 壞. The right-hand element is 裹 (kai) acting as the phonetic, but in older variants it is a mourning graph made by adding 眾—the image of tears streaming from the eyes—to 衣 “clothing,” conjuring the scene of weeping at the collar of a dead person’s garment (the sentiment preserved in 懐/懷). Some ancient forms show those tears falling onto 土 “earth,” the base graph of 社 “shrine,” indicating that such rites were held at the communal shrine. A Zhou-script form further adds 攴 “to strike,” pointing to the ritual dismantling of the clan or regional shrine when people were forced to leave their land. From these rites the sense of tearing down and breaking arose. In the modern Japanese form, 眾 is simplified to 目, omitting the strokes that depict the falling tears."
