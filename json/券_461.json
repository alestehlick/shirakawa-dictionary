  "explanation": "The oldest form of 券 is 劵, which joins 尖 and 刀. Here, Shirakawa reads 尖 as the image of a beast’s claw being held with both hands (廾). The character depicts that claw being cut with a knife, evoking the making of a split tally (warifu): a plate inscribed in the center, then cut in two so that each party kept a matching half as future proof. From this practice, 券 came to mean a tally, check, or certificate. A look-alike, 卷 (巻), instead shows animal hide being rolled up and developed the sense of a scroll or writings."
