  "explanation": "Originally written 擇, this is a phono‑semantic character: the hand on the left shows the act of handling, while the phonetic on the right is 睪 (eki). In ancient forms 睪 depicts an animal’s corpse—eyes (目) above and the limbs (rendered by the element later shaped like 幸) below. With the hand added, the graph pictures picking through a carcass that wind and rain have scattered, taking only the usable parts; from this concrete scene it comes to mean to choose, to select. The same phonetic 睪 signals the on‑reading, as in 鐸 (taku, “great bell”), and a related graph 釈/釋 portrays the scattering and undoing of a corpse with an animal’s claw."
