  "explanation": "This character is a compound of 言 and 攴. In Shirakawa’s view, 言 is not mere “speech,” but the ritual vessel that held solemn words of oath to the gods, its sides adorned with hanging threads. With 攴, “to strike,” added, the graph shows striking that oath‑vessel—an act of rupturing the divine covenant—and from this image arises the sense of changing or altering, and by extension, falling into disorder."
