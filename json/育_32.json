  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 育 as an image rooted in childbirth and care. The graph joins the inverted figure of a newborn—the ‘totsu’ shape of a child descending at birth—with the nikuzuki “flesh” element to mark a human body. He treats 毓 as the original form: it shows the mother, written 每, with the child’s head, hair first, added behind her as it emerges. Both 育 and 毓 thus depict a child being born, from which the meanings expand to giving life and then rearing and nourishing a child—hence the senses of raising, bringing up, and educating."
