  "explanation": "This character began as a straightforward pictograph of stones massed on a mountainside, capturing the solid presence of a rocky outcrop. In the fuller form 巖 (巌), two ritual “sai” receptacles holding covenant writings are set upon a cliff (崖), and perfumed wine is ladled and poured to purify the sacred site. Such rites were performed on crags because rocky places were revered as abodes of the gods. The common Japanese form 岩 is an abbreviated graph widely used with the meaning “rock,” while 巖 is often seen in Chinese literary usage."
