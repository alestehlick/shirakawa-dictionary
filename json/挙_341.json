  "explanation": "Now written 挙 and formerly 擧, the character combines 與 (the older form of 与) with the hand element. 與 depicts a pair of elephant tusks borne on four supporting hands, an image of carrying together, acting in concert. By adding yet more hands and showing the tusks lifted high, 挙 comes to mean raising or offering up. From this, compounds such as 挙行 evoke the offering of things and the conducting of rites or formal functions, and more broadly the carrying out of actions. Because the scene is one of many hands working as one, the character also took on the sense of everyone together—“all,” “entirely.”"
