  "explanation": "宜 depicts offerings laid out in ritual order. In its old form, two 夕—abbreviations of meat—are set upon 且, the 俎 or chopping board, showing meat prepared and arranged for presentation. Later the roof 宀, the eaves of an ancestral shrine or mausoleum, was added, turning the graph into a compound that situates the offering within the sacred precinct. The character thus portrays lining up meat within the shrine to worship and revere ancestors—and by extension the gods. Because the offering is suitable for such rites, the deities give their approval, a sense captured in yoroshi: “right, well, proper.” From this ritual scene comes the general meaning “appropriate, proper, fitting.”"
