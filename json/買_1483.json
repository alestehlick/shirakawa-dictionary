  "explanation": "In the oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, 買 combines the net radical 网 with 貝, the cowrie shells that served as wealth. It depicts gathering shells with a net—an image of acquiring valuables—and so came to mean “to buy,” with a nuance of quietly amassing shells. The Shuowen likewise glosses it as “to buy.” Relatedly, the old form of 売 was written 費, a graph joining 出 and 買 to express spending or releasing the shells one has obtained. From this core sense of acquisition, 買 also extends to “bringing upon oneself” or “inviting,” as in baishu (買愁), “to invite sorrow.”"
