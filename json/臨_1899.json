  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 臨 as a compound of 臥 and 品. 臥 depicts a person with eyes cast downward, while 品 shows three ritual sai—vessels in which written prayers to the gods are placed—set in a row. The graph as a whole portrays the divine spirit in heaven bending to look down in answer to those offerings, an act of overseeing from above. From this sacred scene the word broadened to mean being present at a situation, facing it directly, and by extension supervising or looking down over it. The Book of Odes preserves this sense in the line 神臨女, “The deity was with you,” evoking the god’s attending presence."
