  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 主 as a pictograph of a lamp’s flame. The Shuowen glosses it as the “flame in a lantern,” specifically the fire burning on a tallow plate. Bronze inscriptions render the flicker of the flame itself; the later standard form adds the dish and its stand beneath. In clan rites, the elder—written in an older graph showing a hand holding fire within the ancestral shrine—was the one who tended this sacred flame. Because fire was revered, the bearer of the flame stood at the center of the household and managed its affairs. From that ritual role grew the senses of “master” and “owner,” and by extension “main” or “chief.”"
