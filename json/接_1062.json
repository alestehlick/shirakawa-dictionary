  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph, 接 sets the hand radical alongside the phonetic 妾 (shō). In 妾, the upper element was originally 辛, the form of a large handled tattooing needle; oracle-bone inscriptions from the Yin period record 妾 as women offered to the river god—attendants dedicated to divine service. Because these maidservants served and came into intimate contact with the deity, the core sense of 接 was first “to make contact with the gods,” that is, to associate with or meet the divine, a nuance still felt in expressions for rites honoring the hearth deity. From this sacred contact the word broadened to human spheres: to meet and associate, then further to receiving and entertaining others, drawing near or being adjacent, attending, following after, and continuing."
