  "explanation": "刈 is a phono-semantic compound built on 乂, which depicts crossed blades—scissors—and carries the idea of trimming or cutting. In antiquity 乂 was also used in the sense of bringing order and pacifying. By adding the knife element 刀 to 乂, the graph 刈 narrowed that broader sense to a concrete act of cutting, specifically the reaping and mowing of grass. Thus 乂 provides the sound (gai) and the notion of trimming, while 刀 firmly anchors the character in the realm of cutting with a blade."
