  "explanation": "Being a phono-semantic character, 被 combines the clothing element with 皮 as its phonetic, which supplies the On reading hi and evokes the idea of something that covers a surface. Early lexicography defines it as a sleeping coverlet—long enough to measure one and a half times the body—later called small sleeping quilt (shogahi), and in Japan remembered in the long collared, sleeved nightwear termed 被衾. Thus it first named what one spreads over oneself in sleep—bedclothes, a quilt or nightgown—and by extension the act of putting it on and covering from above. From the notion of being covered came the verbal sense “to receive, to incur, to suffer,” and in compounds such as 被害 and 被告 it expresses the passive idea of being subjected to another’s action. (By contrast, 衾 specifically names the coverlet itself.)"
