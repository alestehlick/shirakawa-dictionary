  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 徳 as a compound of 彳, 省, and later 心. In the oracle‑bone and early bronze forms, 彳 joins 省: 彳, the “step” beside 行, evokes moving along a path, while 省 originally depicts a ritual ornament fixed at the brows to intensify the eyes’ numinous curse‑power, with which one made an inspecting circuit and warded off impurity. With 心 added, the graph came to mean extending the eyes’ purifying authority outward into one’s conduct. At first, then, 徳 named the potent, cleansing force of the gaze; as that force was recognized as arising from an inner human faculty, it took on the sense of virtue—an inherent moral power that makes what is correct and good and bestows grace—hence compounds like 道徳 (morality) and 徳性 (moral character)."
