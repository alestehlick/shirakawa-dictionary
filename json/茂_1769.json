  "explanation": "茂 is a phono-semantic character: the grass radical 艹 signals vegetation, while 戊 provides the sound and points toward the idea of dense growth. The Shuowen defines it as “abundant, flourishing grass,” hence the primary sense “to grow thick, luxuriant,” especially of plants and trees. From this image of vigorous profusion, the meaning extends to “to excel,” as seen in compounds like 茂功 and 茂材. Its on reading aligns with a kindred character, 楙, which the Shuowen explains as “a tree’s thick growth,” reinforcing 茂’s core picture of lush, thriving abundance."
