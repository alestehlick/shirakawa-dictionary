  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 密 as a compound graph of 宀, 必, and the idea of fire. 宀 sketches the roof of a mausoleum where ancestors are revered. 必 originally depicts the head of a weapon—either a pike (戈) or broad axe—fixed to its shaft; in bronze inscriptions for 密 this element appears explicitly as 戈. The character portrays a private rite in which a pike is placed within the mausoleum as a curse-warding implement, then exorcised and purified by fire to calm and pacify the ancestral spirits. Because the ceremony was conducted in hushed secrecy, the graph came to signify “secret, private,” and by extension “closely packed, detailed.” Shirakawa also notes the related graph 秘, which shows offering a 必 in divine worship; together the pair forms 秘密, the notion of what is deliberately kept from sight."
