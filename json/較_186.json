  "explanation": "A phono-semantic compound: the vehicle radical evokes a chariot, while the phonetic element 交—originally shown as 爻, two crossed sticks—gives the sound and image. In early forms the graph pictured the crosspiece that juts from the front balustrade of a chariot, a bar one could lean over. From the idea of two bars set against and projecting past each other, the senses of setting things side by side to compare, and of making distinctions clear, naturally developed."
