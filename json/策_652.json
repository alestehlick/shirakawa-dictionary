  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 策 as a phono-semantic compound: the bamboo radical signals a bamboo or wooden implement, while the phonetic element (朿/束) supplies the sound and originally depicted a long, pointed piece of wood used as a horsewhip. The Shuowen already glosses it as the lash for striking a horse, and expressions such as 杖策 evoke a whip affixed to a staff. From this concrete tool the sense broadened to the bamboo or wooden plates on which characters were written—hence 簡策, “bamboo or wooden slips with writing.” Because plans were set down on such tablets, compounds like 策謀 and 策略 came to mean working out, that is, writing down a stratagem. For the “tablet/writing” sense the older graph is 冊, and royal written directives were called 冊命, later also written 策命. Thus 策 ranges from the tangible “whip, cane” and “writing tablet” to the abstract “plan, policy.”"
