  "explanation": "報 is a compound of 幸 and 艮. In ancient graphs, 幸 depicts the wooden restraints placed on the hands, while 艮 shows a kneeling person held down by a hand—an image that also underlies the 服 of submission. Together they portray a culprit restrained from behind, so the earliest sense was to take countermeasures against a wrong—retaliation. In bronze inscriptions, however, the character is already used in the realm of reciprocity: favor, and the acts of giving back—rewarding, answering, making a return. From this notion of responding and returning, the meaning broadened to the social act of conveying news, hence later uses such as 報告 and 報知 for reporting and informing."
