  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character in which 苗 functions as the phonetic, pointing to a byō-type sound. It is not seen in the earliest inscriptional materials. The Yuan-period Liù Shū Gù notes that its sound is close to 摸 and glosses it as “to copy.” In practice it means to draw or paint and, by extension, to write; at its core it evokes the brush’s sketching lines that give shape to a form—the quick, formative strokes of a draft."
