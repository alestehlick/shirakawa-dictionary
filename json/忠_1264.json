  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 忠 as a phono-semantic character: 中 provides the sound and, in the oldest forms on oracle bones, depicts the banner of the central army with streamers fixed above and below—a sign of command and measured control. United with the heart, it comes to mean focusing one’s mind completely: to devote the heart with sincerity, honesty, correctness, and moderation. Hence its early use in the Analects in compounds such as 忠信 and 忠恕, where it denotes wholehearted sincerity and thoughtful consideration. The specific sense of allegiance to ruler or state crystallized later, in the Warring States period, giving rise to ideals such as 忠義."
