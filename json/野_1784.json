  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character. In the oldest inscriptions the graph appears as 埜, showing a wooded area with a shrine; here 士 is the early graph used for 社, the sacred place of worship. The form 里 combines 田 (fields) with 士 to depict a field precinct centered on a shrine where the field gods were venerated. By adding 予 as a phonetic element to this base, the character 野 is formed. Originally it evoked a sacred grove or cultivated precinct at the outskirts, and its meaning later broadened to the open country—fields and countryside—and by extension the rustic or vulgar."
