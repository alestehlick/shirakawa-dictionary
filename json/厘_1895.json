  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph with 里 as the phonetic element, signaling the on-yomi ri. In early usage it functioned as an abbreviated form of 廛 (also written 店), “shop,” and later came to be used as an abbreviation for 釐 “ri,” meaning to set in order or regulate. In Japan it is read rin and denotes very small measures: one-tenth of a bu in length, one-tenth of a sen in currency, one-tenth of a monme in weight, and, in proportional expressions, one-thousandth (0.1%)."
