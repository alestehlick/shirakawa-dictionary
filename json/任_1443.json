  "explanation": "任 is a picto-phonetic character: the person radical 亻 combines with the phonetic 壬. In ancient forms, 壬 depicts a stout stand set into an earthen floor, used when forging metal and shaping vessels—its thickened middle shows something made to withstand heavy force and weight. Placed beside 亻, it portrays a person capable of bearing a load and standing up to pressure, which naturally extends to taking charge, attending to tasks, and shouldering responsibilities. From this image arise the senses “to entrust/leave to someone,” as in委任, along with ideas of duty, service, and work. 壬 also supplies the on reading for the character."
