  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the stone element provides the idea of “stone,” while 玆 supplies the sound ji and evokes blackness. 玆 itself is formed from two 玄 placed in sequence; 玄 depicts a colored bundle dyed black, so 玆 comes to mean something black. Combined with stone, the graph originally named iron-black stones—natural lodestone—hence “magnet” and “magnetism.” The character also appears in ceramic compounds such as 陶磁器, though the classical graph for “porcelain” is 瓷."
