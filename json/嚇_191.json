  "explanation": "A phono-semantic compound: the mouth element signals “voice,” while 赫—two 赤 set together—serves as the phonetic kaku and conjures a blaze of red, vigorous flourishing, and the flare of fierce anger. 嚇 thus denotes the voice that bursts out in violent anger, and by extension came to mean to cow or overawe—hence “to threaten” and “to scold.” The Zhuangzi (Qiu Shui) vividly illustrates this sense with a kite that has seized a rotten rat, glaring up at a soaring phoenix and letting out a cry of 嚇 to intimidate it."
