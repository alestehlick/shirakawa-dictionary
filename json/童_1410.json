  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character. In bronze inscriptions, the lower part is 東, originally the shape of a bag (the form of 橐), which functions as the phonetic and gives the on reading do. The early upper element combines 辛 and 目, depicting a large tattooing needle above the eyes—the mark of judicial tattooing. The character thus first referred to a person bearing such marks, treated as a slave or servant. Because people so marked were not permitted to wear a chignon, the graph naturally extended to children, who likewise did not wear their hair in a topknot, and 童 came to mean “child.” The “servant” sense later shifted to 僮, as in 僮僕. In later script forms the lower component sometimes follows 重, with 里 as an abbreviated shape."
