  "explanation": "A picto-phonetic graph. The earliest writing is 迹, and an even older form is 速, with 束 as the phonetic. 束 depicts a tree set upright as a landmark; 亦 is a later confusion for 束 and unrelated. In this view, 速 originally described erecting a marker tree as a sign for operations, and from the mark left standing arose the sense of a “trace.” In bronze inscriptions, 賚 is borrowed to write seki in phrases like 禹之賚, “the traces of Yu,” referring to the marks of the flood-tamer’s works spread across the realm. Later, the foot element was added to create 跡 specifically for “footmarks,” which then generalized to any trace. By extension it can express treading or visiting a place by following someone’s traces, and it is often used in place of 蹟."
