  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 訟 as a phono-semantic character: 言 provides the sphere of speech and dispute, while 公 serves as the sound element and depicts the squared ceremonial court—an enclosed precinct where ancestral rites were performed and judicial hearings were held. Rooted in that ritual-judicial setting, the character took on senses such as bringing a suit, adjudicating, and reproaching. Bronze inscriptions already show it in legal collocations like 訊訟 (interrogation and litigation) and 罰訟 (penalty and litigation). The same 公 element marks the on-reading in related characters such as 頌 and 松; in 頌 it evokes the courtly space of song and dance used to praise ancestral virtue, reflected in terms like 頌歌, songs of praise."
