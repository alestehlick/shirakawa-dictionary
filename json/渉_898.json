  "explanation": "Composed of the water element and 歩 (“to step”), 渉 originally pictured stepping into a current to make a ford—hence the sense of wading and crossing. Because river crossings were hazardous, such fording could be imposed on outsiders as an ordeal, and it also acquired a ritual character. Early forms connected with 順 even show 渉 combined with 頁, the head bearing a ritual cap, to depict a figure bowing in reverence to a spirit at a crossing place. Fords thus served not only as practical passage points but also as sites of ceremony, and the character preserves this image of deliberate passage through water."
