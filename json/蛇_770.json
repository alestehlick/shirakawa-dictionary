  "explanation": "Shirakawa understands 蛇 as a phono-semantic character: the left side 虫 supplies the semantic field of reptiles and creeping creatures, while the right side 它 serves as the phonetic. In the oldest forms, 它 itself depicted a snake with an enlarged head and originally carried the meaning of “snake,” but as 它 later came to be used for the sense of “other,” a new graph was formed by adding 虫 to preserve the snake meaning as 蛇. In oracle-bone inscriptions the sign used as the phonetic marker in 祀 already takes the shape of a snake (the form later written 巳), reflecting how snakes figured centrally in early nature worship. Because they dwell in ravines and low, marshy places, snakes were venerated as valley deities, known in Japan as yatonokami, and revered as numinous beings."
