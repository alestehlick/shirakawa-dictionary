  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character formed with the speech element and the phonetic 咨. The phonetic 咨 originally evoked lamenting prayers addressed to the deities—complaining, grieving, and inquiring. As 咨 came to be used chiefly for lamentation (as in shisa, “to lament”), a new graph with the speech radical was created to carry the sense of seeking counsel through words. With shi as its on reading, 諮 expresses speaking out a matter in complaint and inquiry, hence “to consult” (hakaru)."
