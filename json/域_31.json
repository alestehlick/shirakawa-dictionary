  "explanation": "域 is a phono-semantic character with 或 as its sound element. In Shirakawa’s view, 或 depicts the city’s enclosing wall (the i) defended with a pike 戈, evoking a protected, bounded tract of land. When an added outer encircling is placed around 或, it becomes 國, the original form of 国, and 或 itself was once used to write 國. Against this background, 域 denotes the realm governed within a city’s fortress walls and, by extension, a district or zone and the limits that partition or confine it. The same phonetic 或 appears in 閾 (shikii, threshold) and 棫 (a tree name), confirming its role as the on-reading marker."
