  "explanation": "附 is a phono-semantic graph. The right side 付 provides the sound fu and originally meant to give or to add. The left component 阝 (from 阜), in its earliest form, depicted the gods’ ladder— the sacred way by which deities descend and ascend between heaven and earth. Against this backdrop, 附 first evoked adding something to that holy place and, by extension, joining oneself to the divine: uniting with and venerating the deities, even being joined with ancestral spirits in burial. From this ritual core the character broadened to everyday senses such as to attach, to add, to bring together, to be adjacent or affiliated, and to follow, which underlie compounds for neighborhood, adhesion, and affiliation."
