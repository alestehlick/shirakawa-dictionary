  "explanation": "Originally written 緣, this is a phono-semantic character: 糸 “thread” points to textiles, while 彖 serves as the phonetic, indicating an early on-reading like tan. Its core meaning is the frilled edging or selvage of cloth—the decorative binding at a garment’s border. From that literal sense it broadened to any brim, edge, or surrounding margin, and then to the abstract idea of a connecting boundary—ties and relations between people and things, even karmic bonds—as seen in words like 縁故. The modern on-reading en appears to have been encouraged by association with 沿 “to run along,” since a hem lies along the edge. Classical usage preserves the textile setting: in the Zhou Rites, 縁衣, “fringed garments,” names one of the queen’s six ceremonial robes."
