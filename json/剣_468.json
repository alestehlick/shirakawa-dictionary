  "explanation": "Originally written 劍, this is a phono-semantic character: the blade element (刀) provides the meaning ‘sword,’ while 僉 serves as the phonetic, signaling the on reading and appearing likewise in words such as 検 and 験. The Shuowen glosses it as a weapon worn at a man’s belt, the sword carried at the waist (taiken). Specifically, 剣 denotes a tsurugi, a straight, double‑edged sword, in contrast to 刀, which is single‑edged. In Chinese antiquity, the celebrated double‑edged swords of the southern states Wu and Yue were especially renowned."
