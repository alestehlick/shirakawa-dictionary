  "explanation": "Originally a pictograph, 無 shows a dancer with ornamented sleeves fluttering as they move. In oracle-bone (tortoise plastron) and bronze inscriptions it appears in rain-invoking rites, as in 無雩, a ceremony of prayer for rain. Its later use for “not, nothing; there is none,” as in 有無, is a phonetic loan: the graph’s sound was borrowed to write negation. Over time 無 specialized as the standard character for negation, while 舞—formed by combining 無 with 舛, the splayed legs of a dancer—was created to write “to dance” and “dance” explicitly."
