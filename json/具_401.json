  "explanation": "In the earliest forms, 具 combines 廾—two hands placed side by side—with a lower element that, in archaic script, is not a shell (貝) but the tripod vessel 鼎. The character depicts both hands lifting and presenting a tripod, a sacred cooking vessel borne by poles through its handles and used in worship and banquet rites. From this image of carefully arranging and offering what is set in the tripod arose the senses sonaeru, to prepare and provide, and sonawaru, to be furnished or equipped. Because it suggests that everything has been properly set in order, it also came to express tsubusa, in full or in detail. In later usage the meaning broadened to utensils and implements in general."
