  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character built from the mouth sign 口 and the phonetic 今. 今 originally depicts a lidded vessel with a stopper; in this character it supplies the on reading gin and evokes a sound that is held in and subdued. Hence 吟 means to press the lips and let out a quiet voice, a low murmur or moan—seen in 呻吟 (shingin), a groan as if weeping. By contrast, 咏 (ei) conveys a voice drawn out long; paired together in 吟詠 (gin'ei) they denote the chanting of poems and songs. From savoring a poem’s elegance the usage broadened to 吟味 (ginmi), the close “tasting” and scrutiny of something."
