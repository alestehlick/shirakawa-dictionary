  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character. The element 韋 acts as the phonetic, indicating the On reading ei, and is understood as the figure of feet (止) moving back and forth around the encircling walls of a city, evoking the patrol that defends it. With the addition of 行, the sign of crossing or movement along paths, the whole depicts circulating around a city’s perimeter to guard it (kun: mamoru). From this concrete scene of patrol, the meaning broadened to guarding and defense in general."
