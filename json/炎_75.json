  "explanation": "Composed by stacking two instances of the fire graph (火) one above the other, this character vividly pictures flames surging upward in a fierce blaze, hence the sense of “flames.” An even more intensified form with three fires, 焱, shares the on reading en and the same basic meaning. Related variants 焔 and 燄 are phono-semantic spellings based on the same idea. By extension, 炎 also expresses the notion of searing, severe heat, and in compounds it conveys “inflammation.”"
