  "explanation": "The original form 卽 combines a ritual food vessel—identified with the gui bronze offering vessel, written here with the graph 自—and 卩, a kneeling person. It pictures someone kneeling before a served meal and taking a seat, which gives the sense of tsuku, “to take one’s seat,” and by extension “to accede, to ascend (the throne),” as in sokui. From the concrete scene of taking one’s place (sokuseki), the meaning broadened to “on the spot, immediately,” and the character is also used, like soku (則), to mean “namely; that is.” Related graphs evoke the same setting: 鄕 shows people seated facing each other with the vessel between them, and 既 depicts a sated person turning away from the vessel after the meal."
