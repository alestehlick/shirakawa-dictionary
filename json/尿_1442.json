  "explanation": "This graph began as a straightforward pictograph: a person standing in profile, shown urinating. It therefore names the fluid itself, known in old Japanese as ibari. By contrast, the character 屎 combines 尸, indicating the buttocks, with 米, representing pellet-like droppings, to depict excrement. The pairing clarifies that 尿 specifically denotes urine."
