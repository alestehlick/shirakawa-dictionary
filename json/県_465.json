  "explanation": "The character 県 goes back to the older form 縣, which depicts a head hung upside down from a cord: the rope is shown by 系, while the disheveled hair hanging below renders the image vividly. From this scene the graph first meant “to hang” or “to suspend,” and that verbal sense was later assigned to the separately created character 懸. Meanwhile 縣 (and later the simplified 県) was adopted for an administrative unit. In the Zhou period it referred to districts directly subordinate to the central authority; after Qin unification it designated counties placed under prefectures (郡). In Japan, with the 1871 abolition of the feudal domains, the establishment of three urban prefectures (府) and 302 県 marked the beginning of the modern prefectural system."
