  "explanation": "呼 is a phono-semantic character built from 口 “mouth” and 乎 as its phonetic. The element 乎 was originally the full character for this word and depicted a rattling plate (naruko): a small board tied to another by a cord that clacks when shaken, used to call people, drive birds, and, in origin, to summon deities in ritual. From this instrument’s use, 乎 carried the senses “to call” and “to cry out.” When 乎 later came to function in Chinese as a grammatical particle, a new graph was created for the verbal meaning by adding the mouth sign 口, yielding 呼, explicitly marking a vocal act. From the notion of expelling sound from the mouth, the usage broadened to “exhale” or “breathe out.”"
