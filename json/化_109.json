  "explanation": "化 combines 人 “person” with 七, which here is the inverted form of 人, the posture of a corpse. In early writing the figure shows such inverted bodies set head-to-foot, back to back, picturing the loss of vital energy and a person’s passage into death. From this image the meaning broadened to the idea of change itself—the ceaseless alternation of death and life—and further to the transformative power by which nature brings things to growth and by which virtue and thought gently guide and reform others. Thus the character is used for dying, for changing, and for following, and in Japanese it also lives on in readings like bakeru and bakasu."
