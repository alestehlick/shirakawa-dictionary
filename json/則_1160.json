  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 則 as a compound that sets a knife beside the ritual tripod 鼎, picturing the act of cutting or incising text into a bronze vessel. In ancient practice, solemn covenants were engraved on tripods and preserved; thus 鼎 can denote a treaty carved on a round tripod, 劑 (剤) an inscription on a square tripod, and 質 an inscription on a tripod marked with two axes. Because a covenant fixed in bronze was to be observed without alteration, 則 came to mean a rule, regulation, model, or standard, and by extension “to act in accordance with, to conform.” In classical usage it also serves with the sense “namely.”"
