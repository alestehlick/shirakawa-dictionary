  "explanation": "A compound character formed from 云 and 鬼. 云 is the original graph of 雲, showing a cloud or a cloud-like state, while 鬼 depicts the human specter of the dead and, by extension, the realm of spirits. Together they express the “soul,” conceived as a cloud-like qi (pneuma) that, upon death, leaves the person and enters the spiritual world. In contrast stands 魄 (haku), which is tied to the body’s remains; there the element 白 represents the bleached, withered skull. From this core sense, 魂 also comes to mean the inner heart or mind, as in compounds like 魂胆 (secret intention), 詩魂 (poetic spirit), and 商魂 (commercial drive)."
