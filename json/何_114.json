  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 何 as a phono-semantic character. In its oldest forms it depicts a person turning back with mouth open, as if calling out to ask—“what? where?” The component 可 functions as the phonetic indicator for ka and also evokes the act of petitioning the gods for approval, a nuance that accords with the character’s role in expressing inquiry and doubt. Some oracle-bone forms show a man carrying a halberd (戈), indicative of “to carry,” which he treats as a separate lineage from the interrogative 何. From this base the graph came to serve broadly as the general interrogative for ‘what?, where?, which?, when?’ and related senses."
