  "explanation": "薫 is a phono-semantic character whose older form is 薰, composed of the grass radical and the phonetic 熏, read kun. Shirakawa explains that 熏 depicts a bag-like container (the shape written as 東) set over a fire, in which things are heated so that smoke and aroma permeate them. From this scene come the senses of a sweet fragrance or fragrant herb, and also the act of fumigating or scenting. The idea of scent soaking in underlies compounds such as 薰染 (kunsen), where the body is thoroughly imbued with a strong aroma, and by metaphor extends to 薫化 and 薫陶, the gentle moral influence by which one’s virtue permeates and cultivates others."
