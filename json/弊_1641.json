  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph whose original form is 敝. Here 幣 (hei)—the shape of the ceremonial apron—serves as the phonetic and also evokes the ritual object itself, while 攵 (boku, “to strike”) adds the idea of action. Together they picture the apron being battered through use until it is frayed and damaged. The Shuowen glosses 敝 as “to fall prostrate,” even of an animal fallen in death; understood through 敝, 弊 expresses collapse from fatigue and states of being torn or worn out, hence senses such as to fall, to grow tired, and to be tattered."
