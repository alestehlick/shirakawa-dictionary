  "explanation": "In early forms, the left element of 陰 is the sacred ladder (later written as the mound radical 阜) on which the gods ascend and descend. The right side is the old graph 侌, depicting 云 “clouds” confined beneath 今, a lid with a stopper—an image of vapors and pneuma being shut in. In contrast to 陽, which places the radiant sun or jade light before the divine ladder to signify brightness, 陰 shows that light enclosed and the divine breath confined. From this image arise its senses of shutting and covering, and thus the ideas of shade, shadow, and a sky growing overcast; by extension it also comes to mean secrecy and concealment. As a related form, 蔭 names the cool shade cast by luxuriant grass. In thought, 陰 stands in complementary balance with 陽 as the yin half of the cosmic pair."
