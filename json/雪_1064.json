  "explanation": "This character is a pictograph of snowflakes fluttering down. In the oracle-bone forms the flakes are drawn like small feathers, and some variants show them clinging to fine branches, vividly suggesting drifting, settling snow. From this image it naturally came to mean “snow” and “to snow.” By phonetic affinity it was also used in the sense of brushing or wiping away—standing in for verbs like “to wipe” or “to cleanse”—as in the compound 雪辱, “to wipe away disgrace.”"
