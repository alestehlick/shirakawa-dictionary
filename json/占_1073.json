  "explanation": "This character joins 卜, the crack traced in pyromancy, with a receptacle sign written like 口, the vessel that held covenant slips offered in prayer. In tortoise-shell divination a long slot and a conical pit were drilled on the reverse of the plastron; when heat was applied, a fissure sprang on the front—卜 depicts that fissure. 占 therefore portrays offering prayer and reading the crack to ask the gods’ will, and oracle-bone inscriptions even use a plastron-shaped variant in formulas such as “the king divined and said…,” confirming its original sense “to divine.” Because a verdict obtained through divination was taken as absolute, the word later developed the meanings “to occupy,” “to hold,” and by extension “to monopolize.”"
