  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 直 as a compound of 省 and an element depicting a fence or screen that suggests concealment. In his reading, 省 originally shows an ornament affixed at the eyebrows to heighten the eyes’ numinous, curse-like power, and by extension it came to mean inspecting the realm and setting wrongs right. Combined with the idea of something screened off, the character conveys secretly investigating matters and correcting them. From this core sense arise its uses for “to correct” and “correct,” and by natural extension “straight,” “direct,” and a frank, unbent disposition. It also develops the adverbial sense “immediately,” as well as the usage “only, merely,” and even “to be assigned one’s turn” in contexts like night duty (宿直). In Japanese it is the everyday verb for mending and setting things right (naosu/naoru)."
