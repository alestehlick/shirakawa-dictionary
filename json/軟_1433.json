  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats this as a phono-semantic character. Its original form was written 輭, with 耎 serving as the phonetic indicator and already carrying the senses of \"soft\" and \"weak.\" He interprets 耎 as the front-facing figure of a shaman, hair cut short and without a topknot—a person who serves the gods—whose form here intimates pliancy. In established usage the on-reading settled as nan, and the form 軟 came to be used for \"soft, tender, flexible\" and by extension \"weak.\""
