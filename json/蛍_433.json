  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, originally written 螢. It combines the insect classifier 虫 with 熒 (kei), which supplies the sound and the idea of faint, flickering light. Shirakawa explains 熒 as depicting a pine-wood torch with sparks scattering into the dark; that image of drifting points of firelight is likened to fireflies, giving the meaning “firefly.” From this origin come cultural usages such as 蛍雪, evoking study by the dim light of fireflies or snow, and modern terms like 蛍光 for fluorescent light."
