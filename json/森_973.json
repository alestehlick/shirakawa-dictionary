  "explanation": "This character is a compound ideograph built from three instances of the tree graph 木. Brought together, the three trees express not a modest grove like 林—often a stand of trees near human settlements—but a broad, primeval expanse where trees grow thick and wild. Such deep woods were imagined as the dwelling place of deities, and in antiquity even 社 (shrine) could be read mori, “woods.” From this sense arises the compound 森厳 (shingen), describing a solemn, awe‑filled atmosphere in which the presence of the gods can be felt."
