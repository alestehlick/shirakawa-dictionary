  "explanation": "A pictograph of the eye. In early script the eye was drawn broad and horizontal; in the modern form it has become taller and vertical. As the organ that first engages the outer world, the eye naturally became a prime motif in character formation, yielding graphs such as 臣, 望, 監, 相, 限, 見, and 看 that incorporate 目 as a core element. Looking is the first act in meeting another person, and by extension the character also touches on silent communication of the mind. Related forms clarify this focus: 眉 depicts the brows set above the eyes, while 媚 originally evoked a woman shaman with fixed, adorned eyebrows. Because the eyes and brows are the most striking features of the face, the compound 眉目 came to mean one’s facial features or overall appearance."
