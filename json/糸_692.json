  "explanation": "Originally written as 絲, this character is a compound made by doubling the thread sign, each element shaped like a small bundle of strands. The Shuowen explains it as “what silkworms spit,” namely raw silk, and from that concrete image it came to mean thread more generally, not only silk. Sericulture was already ancient, and oracle-bone inscriptions even record the worship of a silkworm deity—an early cultural backdrop that lends the graph both ritual resonance and the vivid picture of bundled threads."
