  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 浮 as a phono-semantic graph: the water element provides the scene, while 孚 serves as the phonetic fu and depicts a hand placed over a child—an image of grasping, also seen in 俘. Together they picture reaching down from above to pull up a child who has fallen into water, giving the senses “to float,” “to rise to the surface,” and “to drift.” Related graphs refine the posture of a body borne by water: 泛 shows a drowned person floating face up, and 汜, face down. By extension, 浮 comes to describe things without firm footing, as in 浮言 and 浮説—rumors with no real ground."
