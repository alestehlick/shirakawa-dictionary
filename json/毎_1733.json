  "explanation": "Originally this graph shows a woman with her hair bound up and set with ornaments. In bronze inscriptions it carries the sense of earnest exertion—being diligent and making an effort. The related character 敏, whose ancient form combines 毎 with 又 “hand,” pictures a hand added to the hair ornament, arranging it in readiness; from this image it conveys zealous, attentive engagement in ritual. The familiar meanings “always” and “each time, every” arose later as a loan usage attached to its Chinese reading."
