  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 隔 as a phono-semantic compound. The right element 鬲 (reki), an earthen cauldron sometimes tripod-footed or pointed, serves as the phonetic. Such hollow vessels were believed to house a spirit and were set in rows at the margins of sacred precincts to define their boundary—an idea reminiscent of the haniwa that encircle ancient Japanese tomb mounds. The left element 阝 originally depicted stepped ladders or terraces used by the gods in their comings and goings. Bronze inscriptions from early Zhou record a kan rite in which libations were poured when crossing this threshold. Thus the graph shows a sacred vessel set before the divine steps, expressing the act of setting the sacred apart from the ordinary; in later usage it broadened to the general sense of separating, dividing, or keeping things apart."
