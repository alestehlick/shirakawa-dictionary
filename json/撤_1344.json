  "explanation": "A picto-phonetic character: the phonetic element is 徹 (tetsu), which guides the on-yomi, while the semantic core is a hand (又/手) taking up a reki, the tripod kettle 鬲 used in ritual banquets. It pictures the act of ending a display—lifting the kettle away after worship—so it came to mean to withdraw, pull up, or remove. Its original sense survives in the expression 撤饌 (tessen), the clearing away of offerings set before the gods."
