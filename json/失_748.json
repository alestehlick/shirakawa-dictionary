  "explanation": "In its earliest pictographic form, 失 shows a dancer with arms flung upward, the figure of a female shaman leaping in ritual to the point of self-forgetfulness. From this image of trance—literally losing one’s awareness—the meaning broadened to losing something in general. Related graphs trace other facets of the same ecstatic rite: 佚 depicts relaxed enjoyment, 夭 portrays a shaman’s head inclined and body sinuously twisting (the basis of 妖), and 迭 evokes the alternation between low and exalted, frenzied movements. In later usage, 失 naturally extended to errors and mishaps, as seen in compounds like kashitsu (error) and shikka (accidental fire)."
