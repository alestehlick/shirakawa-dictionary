  "explanation": "In early forms, the element 酉 points both to the sound and to ritual wine, and Shang-period emblems even depict a figure ladling fragrant wine from a jar, the hair tied up in three distinct tufts, adopting a special ceremonial posture. This scene represents a rite called 醜, performed with sacrificial wine. Oracle-bone inscriptions record divinations such as “have 醜?”—consultations on whether to carry out this ceremony to dispel a village curse—showing that the term and graph were already established in the ritual sphere. From the striking, out-of-the-ordinary appearance of the officiant in this rite, the character developed the sense “ugly, unsightly,” and by extension came to mean “bad” and “shameful.”"
