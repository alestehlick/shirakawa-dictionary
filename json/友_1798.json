  "explanation": "友 combines two instances of 又, the right hand, picturing hands joined in mutual help; from this image it came to mean a friend or companion, and by extension, to be intimate or to associate. In some bronze forms a small graph for a covenant vessel that held prayer writings to the gods (sai/etsu) is added, showing a hand laid upon it to swear an oath—an emblem of a mutual pledge of friendship. The compound 朋友 in bronze inscriptions referred to fellow members of the same clan; here 朋 originally depicts two shells threaded together as a matched pair, a pairing metaphor later transferred to human relationships."
