  "explanation": "哀 combines 衣, the robe with an overlapping collar, and 口, which in ancient ritual writing is not a mouth but the sai, a small container for prayer slips offered to the gods. In funerary practice a sai was tucked into the collar of the deceased’s garment while prayers were said to call the soul back—rites known as tamayobai and shokon. The graph names this compassionate mourning for the dead, hence its senses of sorrow and pity. Related collar-centered mortuary graphs include 袁 (the base of 遠), showing a jade placed at the collar with the step-sign 之 by the pillow to send the departed on their way, and 衰, showing a hemp mourning band fixed at the collar to avert misfortune; many characters share this same structural idea."
