  "explanation": "好 combines the graphs for woman (女) and child (子). In oracle-bone and bronze forms it appears as a woman cradling a child, expressing the original sense of a mother cherishing her infant. This nurturing affection is echoed in the Book of Odes, which says 妻子好合, “wife and children in loving harmony.” From this core idea the character came to describe what is beautiful and pleasing, what is intimate and friendly, and more broadly anything in a favorable, good state—hence its later use for liking or being fond of something."
