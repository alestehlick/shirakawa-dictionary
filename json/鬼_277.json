  "explanation": "A pictograph of a human ghost or demon, marked off from the living by its large head. In oracle-bone forms, some graphs omit the later cloud mark and instead show dripping dots, evoking the purification and exorcism performed by pouring perfumed wine. Other early forms add the altar sign 示, originally a ritual table set out for worship. The small stroke group later written like ム seems to depict clouds (云), and in subsequent development this line contributes to the graph 魂 for the human soul. 鬼 thus names the ghost of a person, while 神 refers to the gods of the natural world; together they form 鬼神, “ghosts and deities,” the realm of the departed among the divine."
