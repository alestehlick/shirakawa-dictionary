  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: the bamboo element shows the material of the object, while 相 serves as the phonetic, giving the on-reading sou. The Shuowen explains it as the storage box mounted on a large carriage, a container for transporting goods, and the sense later broadens to any lidded box made of wood or bamboo. From this come cultural usages such as hakogaki, an inscription or seal on a box lid certifying the authenticity of the artwork or craft within, and hakoiri musume, “a daughter kept in a box,” describing a girl so carefully sheltered she is scarcely allowed out."
