  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: early forms appear as 燠 and 煖, written with the fire or sun element to show heat, combined with a right-hand phonetic that marks the on-reading. Shirakawa identifies that phonetic as the frontal figure of a shaman with shorn hair—an officiant who served the gods. In times of drought and famine, rain-invoking rites included burning such shamans; paired with the fire/sun element, this ritual image yielded the sense of warmth and heat. The series used 燠, 煖, and 暖 for related meanings such as “warm” and “to warm (up),” and in later usage the form with the sun radical, 暖, became the standard character."
