  "explanation": "習 is a compound graph with 羽, “feather,” above and, in its earliest forms, not the later 白 “white,” but the shape of a sacred receptacle that held covenant or prayer texts. The core act is to rub a feather over this container to activate and amplify the efficacy of the prayer. By its very nature this was something performed again and again, and from that repeated ritual the character came to express repetition and, by extension, learning through practice, becoming accustomed, and the piling up of actions that form habit and custom. Although later views treated the lower element as 白 and glossed the whole as “to fly often,” the oracle and bronze forms preserve the vessel beneath 羽. Feathers themselves were potent ritual objects and decorations, even affixed to arms and shields; the graph 単 depicts two feather ornaments on an oval shield, echoing this ritual-ornamental context in which 習 took shape."
