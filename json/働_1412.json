  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 働 as a phono-semantic character: the person radical on the left marks a human agent, while 動 on the right supplies the sound and evokes the idea of exertion. He traces 動 back to 力, the force of the plow, and to an original sense of setting to work in the fields, which broadened to activity and exertion. 働 itself was coined in Japan and, especially from the Meiji period, served to render Western concepts of “work” in compounds such as 稼働 (operation) and 労働 (labor), later circulating in China for a time. Altogether, the graph depicts a person engaged in purposeful activity—working."
