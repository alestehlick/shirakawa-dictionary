  "explanation": "The original form is 惡, a phono‑semantic graph with 亞 (亜) as its sound element. Shirakawa understands 亞 as a plan view of an underground tomb chamber—a realm of the dead that the living instinctively avoid as taboo. The character thus came to write the feeling of abhorrence or detestation, set in contrast to love or affection. In later usage its sense broadened to the general “bad” of the polar pair 善悪, good and evil."
