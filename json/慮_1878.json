  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats 慮 as a phono-semantic graph: the phonetic element 呂 points to the On reading ryo, while the character expresses the act of careful thought—“to plan and think,” as the Shuowen glosses it—hence omonpakaru, to consider. The phrase 弗慮弗圖 in the Book of Odes already uses the word in the sense of “no forethought, no planning,” showing its antiquity. Yet the specific graph 慮 does not appear in oracle-bone or bronze inscriptions; in Warring States bronze (the Zhongshan King Square Tripod), the word is written with a phonetic loan that reflects the reading, making clear that the form was not built with 思, but centered on the phonetic element from which its sound and sense of weighing matters arise."
