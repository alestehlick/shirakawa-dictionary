  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: 半 supplies the on-reading and the notion of division, originally depicting an ox split in two as a sacrificial offering, while the graph as a whole refers to fields divided from one another. It first named the line that separates adjoining fields, hence the ridge or levee between paddies and, by extension, a boundary. From the sense of an edge it also came to mean the bank or shore—the waterside or lakeside—as in kohan (lakeside). In compounds it can also stand in place of 叛 with the sense of opposing, as in hangyaku."
