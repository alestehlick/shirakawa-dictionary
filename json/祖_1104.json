  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 祖 as a phono-semantic character: 示 marks the realm of ritual, while the phonetic 且 (read so) originally depicted a 俎, the sacrificial chopping board on which offerings were arrayed. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, 且 itself already functions with the meaning “ancestor,” standing as the earliest form of 祖. Early ritual depictions show strips of meat—written with 夕 as an abbreviation of 肉—placed above and below the 俎 within the ancestral shrine. When the altar sign 示 was later added to make the sacrificial setting explicit, the graph took the form 祖. From the reverence for forebears as the first in a lineage, the sense naturally extends to “origin” or “foundation,” and, because ancestors serve as exemplars, to the notion of a model or standard."
