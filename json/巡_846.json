  "explanation": "A phonetic–semantic character: the walking radical (辵/辶) conveys the act of going about, while the phonetic component 巛, a variant of 川 “river,” originally depicted the branching irrigation channels of a field (畎澮). The Shuowen glosses it as “to look and go around,” the sense embodied in an inspection tour (視察・巡行). From this image it came to mean to go around, to patrol and make the rounds, and to move in a circuit. Because it shares the same on-reading, it can interchange with characters like 循 and 徇 in older usage."
