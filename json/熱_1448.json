  "explanation": "This character combines the gei component, picturing a young tree being planted in the soil, with the fire sign. Fire was added to evoke the warm, life-fostering conditions favorable to planting and cultivation, so the word originally referred to a warm season or climate. A Zhou text (Yi Zhou Shu, Zhou Zhu Jie) already sets it within a cosmic pair: “Between heaven and earth there is cold and heat.” From there its meanings settled into ‘hot,’ ‘heat, temperature,’ and, by extension, fervent, concentrated feeling—hence its use in words for zeal and ardor."
