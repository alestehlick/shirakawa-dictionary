  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 劾 as a phono-semantic graph with 亥 supplying the on-reading gai and the side element shaped like 力 reflecting the form of 耒, a plow. He anchors its sense not in legal procedure but in ancient exorcistic rites: 亥 is the figure of an animal that, when blamed for a visiting tatari (a calamity or curse), was ritually beaten to dispel the misfortune—an act called oniyarai and written with graphs such as 毅. Related characters preserve the same ritual logic: 弾 is the twanging of a bowstring sounded to drive off malign forces around a dwelling, and the old form of 改 depicts beating a snake (巳) to purge a curse. Seen in this family, 劾 belongs to practices of beating and sounding to expel evil, a nuance echoed in 弾劾, which originally evoked driving out malice by bowstring and ritual blows and only later came to mean attacking or arraigning a person. Classical sources even describe “kaikai” as a potent talisman hung at the waist to ward off epidemics, emphasizing the word’s exorcistic core; in compounds like 劾罪 it turns toward the investigation and exposure of wrongdoing."
