  "explanation": "巧 is a phono-semantic character. The left element, 工, serves as the sound marker for kō and shows a work implement, while the right element depicts a small, bent knife used in making vessels and utensils. Both components evoke the craftsman’s toolkit, but the knife side carries the core sense: the precise, deft work done with a fine blade. From this image the character came to mean skillful work and skillfulness itself, then broadened to adroit excellence in human actions and behavior, as seen in compounds like 巧言 (artful words, flattery) and 巧笑 (a lovely—sometimes affected—smile)."
