  "explanation": "Shirakawa parses 答 as a phono-semantic graph with 合 as its phonetic core. In early usage, 合 itself bore the sense “to respond,” and bronze inscriptions even show it in phrases meaning “to respond to virtue.” The form of 合 depicts a lid set upon a ritual receptacle 口—a covenant vessel that held written prayers—evoking the precise fitting of lid and container, and by extension the idea of a response that matches what is asked. This phonetic value of 合 is shared by characters such as 荅 (tō). Over time, 答 became the established character for answering in the context of a question."
