  "explanation": "支 is a compound graph that joins the sign for a small tree-branch with the hand (又), picturing a hand grasping a twig. In early usage it served as the original character for “branch” (later written as 枝), set in contrast to 本 “root,” and thus came to mean what splits away from the main line: a branch, to branch off, or to divide. This contrast is echoed in the term 干支, “trunk and branches,” for the sexagenary cycle. Because wooden branches are used to prop things up, the character naturally also took on the sense “to support,” as seen in compounds like 支持 and 支柱."
