  "explanation": "鈴 is a phono-semantic character with 令 as its phonetic core. Shirakawa reads 令 as a kneeling figure under a deep ritual cap, receiving a divine message, and in this character it carries the clear, summoning ring of a bell. Bells were instruments to invite the gods to descend and to send them off, so 鈴 names the ritual suzu. The same ritual-musical sphere is reflected in related words and forms: 伶人 were originally attendants serving the gods, later court musicians; 楽 (樂) shows the form of a handled handbell; and 玲 evokes the bright, jewel-like chime of a tama (ball). In Japanese it is also read rin, as in yobirin, a doorbell."
