  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 退 as a compound whose older, proper form is written like 復, combining three elements: 彳, the step sign from the left half of 行 that suggests a short movement; 皿, the ritual dish piled with offerings; and 夊, a foot turned backward. In Shang–Zhou inscriptions this depicts returning the heaped offering vessels to their place after the rite has concluded, and from that scene arise meanings such as to draw back, to retreat, and to put something back or pull it down. In divinatory usage, the omen-bird 隹 figures in deciding whether to continue or desist: 遂 names the outcome of proceeding, while 退 names the outcome of withdrawing. Over time those earlier graphs fell out of use, and 退 became the standard character for retreat and withdrawal."
