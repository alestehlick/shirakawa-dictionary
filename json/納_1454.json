  "explanation": "Composed of the thread sign 糸 with 内 (nai) as the phonetic, 納 is a phono-semantic character whose earliest sense was the payment of textiles as tax. From this concrete act of handing in cloth, the meaning broadened to paying, delivering or supplying something, and by extension to putting or setting something in. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, the bookkeeping term for receipts and disbursements (suito) appears as 出内 or 出入, showing the older practice before 納 became the standard graph—an adoption that took hold from the Warring States period onward."
