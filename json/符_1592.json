  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: the bamboo classifier (竹) shows the material of early tallies, while 付 supplies the sound and evokes the act of handing something to another with the hand. From this, 符 came to mean an object given as a mark of authorization or proof—hence a tally, token, or sign. The Shuowen glosses it as a “tally.” In Han times, bamboo edicts about six sun in length were split and later matched; these paired pieces, called “bamboo-joint tallies” (竹節), were made in identical form so that the piece held by a recipient served as proof when joined. For important purposes they were cast in bronze: in 1957 the bronze joint tallies of Lord Qi of È (鄂君啓節) were unearthed—a vehicle tally and a ship tally—faithfully imitating the form of the bamboo originals."
