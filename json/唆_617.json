  "explanation": "唆 is a phono-semantic character formed with the mouth element 口, signaling speech, and the component 夋 as the phonetic. The phonetic value appears in related graphs such as 梭 (sa, a weaver’s shuttle), indicating the on reading sa here. From the idea of working on someone with words, the character came to mean coaxing or instigating a person; Shirakawa notes that this sense likely preserves an onomatopoetic echo of the cajoling sounds of urging speech, reflected in the verb sosonokasu."
