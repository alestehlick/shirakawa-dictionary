  "explanation": "Originally written as 餘, this is a phono-semantic character: 食 “food” provides the semantic frame of provisions, while 余 supplies the sound. In the Shuowen it is glossed as 饒 “abundant,” evoking plentiful food; from this sprang the later, general sense of what is left over—excess and remainder. In modern usage the simplified 余 stands as the standard form for 餘. Shirakawa further distinguishes another 余 depicting a long-handled needle. In medical imagery this tool pierces an abscess and drains it into a basin, which underlies the sense of recovery in graphs such as 愈 and 愉; as a ritual implement it was thrust into the earth to expel malign spirits hidden below, a nuance that colors 徐 and 途 with the idea of an eased, purified way. The use of 余 as the first-person pronoun “I” is a later loan based on its sound."
