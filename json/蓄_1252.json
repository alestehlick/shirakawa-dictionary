  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: the grass radical suggests vegetation gathered and piled up, while 畜 serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading chiku. The Shuowen defines its core sense as “to accumulate.” The phonetic element was understood as a bundle of threads left steeping in a dye vat for a long time, an image of slow, sustained accumulation. From the ideas of heaping up grass and prolonged storing, the character came to mean to gather, pile up, and store. In line with the sense carried by 畜, it can also mean to raise or support, as with livestock."
