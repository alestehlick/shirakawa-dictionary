  "explanation": "必 is a pictograph of the head of a weapon—a pike, halberd, or broad axe—fixed to its haft at the socket. In early writing it named that fitting itself, and as a sacred implement it figured in ritual. From this base grew a cluster of graphs tied to ritual solemnity and guarded conduct—宓 (peaceful, calm), 祕/秘 (secret), 密 (close, secret), 毖 (careful), and related shrine terms—originally referring to ceremonies employing that weapon-head as a sacred utensil. The familiar sense “certainly; without fail” is a later phonetic loan: bronze inscriptions actually write this adverb with 弋, while 必 served its older, implement-based meaning (it is the original graph behind 秘/祕, with the separate form 袐 later created). Thus 必 first depicts the blade-head secured to the handle, and only later came to express inevitability."
