  "explanation": "In its original form 妥 combines a hand (爪) placed above a woman (女), picturing a hand soothing someone, and by extension “to make peaceful.” Classical glosses describe it as “to sit calmly,” and it even served as the original graph for 綏 in phrases like 綏安, “to pacify.” In compounds such as 妥協 and 妥結 it conveys bringing matters into a settled, moderate state through accommodation, which is why 妥当 expresses what is apt or proper. The character thus centers on calmness and gentle moderation—making things peaceful and appropriately settled."
