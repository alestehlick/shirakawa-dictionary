  "explanation": "蒸 is a phono-semantic character built with 烝 as its phonetic, which points to the Sino-Japanese reading jo. The Shuowen explains the original referent as ogara: the inner hemp stalk stripped of its bark and used as a wick or torch—what is commonly called makotsuho. Light and easily bundled, such stalks served as brushwood alongside firewood, as in the pair 薪蒸. From this concrete image, the character’s sense broadened: first to the act and effect of heating until vapor rises—‘to steam’ and the sultry, muggy condition that results—and, by association with 烝, further to the idea of ‘many, in great number.’"
