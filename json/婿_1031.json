  "explanation": "A phono-semantic compound: the 女 element places the character in the realm of marriage and kinship, while 胥 functions as the phonetic, yielding the On reading sei. Classical sources treat 壻 as the orthodox form and gloss it as “husband,” and the Fangyan records that in the Eastern Qi region it was pronounced with the On of 倩 (sei), a graph meaning “to borrow/loan” that here serves as a sound reference. Related graphs such as 甥 cluster around male kin, reinforcing the sense of an affinal male relation—hence “son-in-law.” In later usage, 婿 circulated as the popular (vulgar) form of 壻."
