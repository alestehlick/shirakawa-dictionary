  "explanation": "Originally written 髮, the character goes back to a bronze-inscription form that combines 首 “head” with 犬 “dog,” evoking an apotropaic rite in which a dog was offered to avert calamity. The later character is built as a phonetic–semantic graph: the long-hair radical conveys the image of streaming tresses, while 發 (hatsu) provides the sound, giving the on reading hatsu. In use it denotes kami, kaminoke—hair of the head—and even calls to mind hyō, the fluttering of long hair, which the radical’s form vividly suggests."
