  "explanation": "The original form is 竝, made by placing two instances of 立 side by side. Since 立 depicts a person standing as seen from the front, 竝 shows two people standing left and right in a row, which naturally gives the sense of “to line up,” “to form a line,” and, by extension, “and,” “together,” and “all.” In Japanese it also carries the everyday sense of nami, “average” or “ordinary,” as in expressions like hitonami and sekkennami, and appears in words such as namiki, “a row of trees.” A related form shows the pair aligned front to back, and this became the original graph for 併; that form is sometimes used in its place."
