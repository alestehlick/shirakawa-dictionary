  "explanation": "Shirakawa interprets 逐 as a compound built on the movement element 辵, with the earliest forms showing a dog 犬 following the track marks 之, a pictograph of footprints. The image is of a dog setting off after a trail, which naturally yields the core sense “to pursue, to chase,” and by extension “to follow” and “to drive out.” From the notion of going after something in sequence, the word also comes to be used for competing and running. Relatedly, 追 is used when speaking of sending out forces to pursue an enemy."
