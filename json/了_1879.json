  "explanation": "Shirakawa understands 了 as a pictograph of something being twisted or wound. The Shuowen already glosses it as “entangled,” and the graph evokes the shape of intertwined strands. From the way a tangled or knotted thread brings movement to a halt, the character naturally came to mean “to finish, to come to an end.” In graphic and semantic affinity with forms such as 繚 (to wrap, to wind) and with 瞭 (clear), it also extends to intellectual clarity—hence uses meaning “to comprehend, to understand,” and “clear.”"
