  "explanation": "議 is a phono-semantic character formed with 言, the element of speech, and 義 as the sound. In Shirakawa’s reading, 義 originally signified the certifying of a sacrificial sheep as flawless—hence what is correct—and this ritual backdrop colors 議. The earliest sense was hakaru: to take counsel, specifically to consult with the gods in order to arrive at what is right. From that sacred act of consultation grew the broader meanings of deliberation and discussion; the same nuance lies behind compounds such as 謀議. A Shinto norito preserves this atmosphere in the phrase 神議りに議りたまひて, “to consult as one consults with the gods,” where hakaru captures the solemn act of seeking divine counsel."
