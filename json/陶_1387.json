  "explanation": "陶 is a phono-semantic character with 匋 as its phonetic. In early writing, 匋 depicts an earthen jar (缶) set into a kiln (窯) for firing. The left element 阝 marks the sacred precinct associated with the gods’ ladder, the place by which deities ascend and descend. Together they portray pottery being fired before that holy site—vessels made as offerings to the gods—hence the core sense “pottery, ceramic ware.” From this ritual scene the meaning broadened to pottery in general, and then figuratively to the idea of shaping and nurturing—“to cultivate, to train”—as seen in 陶育 and 陶冶; it also appears in expressions for being carried away or weighed down in feeling, as in 陶酔 “rapt intoxication” and 鬱陶 “gloom.”"
