  "explanation": "An indicative graph showing three counting rods laid one above another, reflecting how numbers were tallied; in oracle-bone inscriptions the numerals from one to four appear in just this way. The shape also evokes three ornamental hairpins gathered and set into a coiffure, a motif that lies behind 参 and suggests the idea of assembling. Three thus names the triad of heaven, earth, and human, revered as a sacred number, and many traditional named groupings (meisu) are organized by threes, proliferating into the hundreds and thousands."
