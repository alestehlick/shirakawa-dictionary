  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 抑 as a compound graph that sets the hand 手 against 卬, a figure of two people facing one another. When those facing figures are arranged vertically, the scene becomes one person lying face up while another holds them down. Viewed from below this relation yields 仰, “to look up,” but seen from above it becomes 抑, with the hand pressing down. The character thus expresses the act of stopping or suppressing by pushing and holding something down."
