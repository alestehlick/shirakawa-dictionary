  "explanation": "婆 is a phonetic–semantic character: the 女 element signals “woman,” while the phonetic component—originally written with forms such as 波, 磐, or 般—provides the sound value ba/ban. The link with 般, associated with carefree enjoyment (as in 般楽), is felt in the compound 婆娑, which depicts the swaying figure of a dancing woman; Song Yu’s Goddess Poems describe her as “moving among humankind” (人間に婆娑たり). In later usage it appears in words like 産婆 (midwife) and 老婆 (old woman), and in the expression 老婆心, “grandmotherly solicitude,” the impulse to care more than is strictly necessary. The character thus centers on the figure of an older woman, colored by images of graceful movement and warm, attentive care."
