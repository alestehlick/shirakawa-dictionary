  "explanation": "Shirakawa interprets 涯 as a phono-semantic character: the water element 氵 sets the scene at the water’s edge, while 厓 (gai) supplies the sound and the image of an abrupt boundary like a cliff. Characters built with 厓 share this on-reading—such as 崖 “cliff,” 啀 “to snarl, quarrel,” and 睚 “outer corner of the eye”—and carry a sense of sharpness or hard-edged form. Within 厓 lies 圭, depicting earth heaped up into a wall-like, sharply defined mass. 涯 therefore names the steep bank that resembles a cliff at the water, and by extension comes to mean the farthest edge—the limit or end."
