  "explanation": "This character is a pictograph of a person armored on both front and back. Donning armor safeguards the body, which gives the sense of aiding or supporting, while the armored shell also creates distance—keeping others at bay. From this image arise nuances of standing apart to preserve one’s own will, as in kaizen (firm resolve), and a fastidious, uncompromising stance, as in kenkai. In 仲介 (mediation), 介 functions much like 界 (boundary), evoking the border where two sides meet and the intermediary stands between them."
