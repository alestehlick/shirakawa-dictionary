  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the walk/road element (辵) indicates movement along a path, while the accompanying component depicts a spiritually potent animal used in divination. Originally, it referred to divining with such an animal to determine whether to continue an undertaking while on the road, and then proceeding on that basis. From this, 遂 came to mean to keep on and bring something to completion—hence senses like “to do, to accomplish” and “to carry through”—and, through usage in compounds such as 遂行 (carrying a matter through to the end), it also developed the adverbial sense “finally, at last” (tsui ni). A related graph, 術, shows divination performed at a crossroads using the potent 朮 plant."
