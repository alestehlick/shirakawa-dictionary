  "explanation": "術 is a compound graph built from 行 and 朮. 行 shows great roads crossing at a junction—a place where many spirits were believed to pass—so crossroads became sites for potent ritual practice. 朮 represents an animal endowed with spirit power. At such roads, diviners employed the spirit-guided techniques associated with 述 and 遂 to consult fate and determine whether an army should attack or advance, and then to proceed in accordance with that verdict. From this sense of efficacious ritual technique, 術 broadened to mean cultivated skill and learned method, and now extends to fields such as technology, the arts, and scholarship."
