  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 回 as a pictograph of water whirling in a deep place—a pool or eddy seen from above. From this image of circling flow arise the senses of turning, revolving, and rotating, and by extension the idea of returning to where one began. He aligns 回 with related graphs formed on the same imagery: 淵 depicts the deep pool where water gathers and swirls, and 洄 shows the act of water circling back on itself. This shared motif was felt even in classical naming, as with Confucius’s disciple Yan Hui (顔回), whose style name Ziyuan (子淵) pairs 回 and 淵—both evoking water that turns round and round."
