  "explanation": "懸 is a phono-semantic compound. Its phonetic base 縣 (later 県) originally pictured a head hung upside down from a tree by a rope, conveying the concrete act of hanging or suspending. When the heart component 心 was added, the sense extended from a physical suspension to a mind fastened onto something—concern that weighs on the heart, as in 懸念, a worried, lingering thought. Over time, 縣 came to denote an administrative district, while 懸 retained the older meaning of “to hang, to suspend.” The character 係, which depicts tying a decorative cord to a person and binding them, is close in sound and shares the core idea of fastening. In Japanese usage, 懸想 evokes a heart attached to another—falling in love."
