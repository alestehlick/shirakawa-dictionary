  "explanation": "Early forms such as 窗 and related shapes are straightforward pictographs of a window. The modern Japanese form 窓 is a simplified development from 窗, while the variant 囪 serves as a phonetic that points to the on-yomi sō. The Shuowen notes that when the opening is set in a wall (牆) it is called 牖—an aperture or light-opening—and when within a room it is a window, evoking a framed opening to the sky, like a skylight. In practice, 窓 is used simply for “window.” The added 心 component may have been intended to suggest clarity or keen insight (as in 聡明), though the character itself is not used with that sense."
