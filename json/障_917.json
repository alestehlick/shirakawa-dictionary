  "explanation": "障 is a phono-semantic character built with 章 as its phonetic, giving the On reading shou, and 阝 (originally 阜) as its semantic element. Shirakawa understands 阜 as the form of a divine ladder by which the gods ascend and descend—an emblem of a sacred approach that must be protected. Within the 章 series, related graphs such as 鄣 already carry the sense of shielding or defending, and here that sacred-guarding nuance produces meanings like to screen off, to separate, and to block. From the idea of preserving a holy precinct by setting up a barrier comes the broader range of senses: a partition or screen, and by extension an impediment or obstacle. In Japanese usage, this appears in sawaru, “to affect or harm,” as in nebusoku wa karada ni sawaru, where insufficient sleep adversely affects one’s health."
