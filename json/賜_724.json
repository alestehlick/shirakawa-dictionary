  "explanation": "Originally written with the graph 易, this was not the 易 of “change” but a picture of ritual bestowal: wine being poured from the spout of a handled爵 vessel, the flowing liquor clearly shown, and in some forms even both hands presenting the cup. In that early graph, 易 supplied the sound shi while also evoking the act of conferring wine—“to grant.” As the notion broadened from ceremonial wine to the granting of goods in general, the cowry 貝, the ancient sign of valuables and currency, was added to form 賜. Later, the character 錫 (shaku) was also used with the sense “to bestow.” The elevated tone of this act survives in expressions such as 賜死, “to grant death,” i.e., to order suicide."
