  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 各 as a compound of 夂 and 囗: 夂 is an inverted footprint that signifies descent from above, while 囗 is the ritual receptacle sai into which written prayers to the deities were placed. The graph thus pictures a god coming down in answer to those petitions, giving the original sense itaru, to arrive or come. This sacred descent underlies related graphs: 召 denotes the act of calling and inviting the deity to descend (and became the base of 招), and characters containing 各 often carry the nuance of reaching or arriving; 路, for example, refers to ritually purifying the streets through kami-oroshi, the drawing down of the divine. Because 各 depicts the descent of a single deity—by contrast with 皆, which shows all the gods descending in line—it naturally developed the meaning “each,” “one by one,” and “respective.”"
