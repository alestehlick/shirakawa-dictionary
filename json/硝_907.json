  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph, 硝 combines the stone radical to show a mineral with the phonetic 肖, which signals the on-reading sho. It names niter (saltpeter), a translucent, glassy crystal composed chiefly of potassium nitrate that burns with a violet flame. Valued both as a potash fertilizer and, for its vigorous oxidizing power, as a key ingredient of gunpowder, it figures in China’s early gunpowder tradition—credited to discoveries made in Daoist alchemical experiments and already in practical use before the Northern Song, as evidenced by the Wujing Zongyao printed in 1044."
