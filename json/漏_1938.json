  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character. Its older graph shows the sign for eaves (shi), paired with rain, picturing rain seeping under the eaves—an image that both supplied the sense of “leak” and served as the phonetic that yields the on reading rou. By adding the water element to that original form, 漏 came to mean specifically the leaking of water and then broadened to cover leaking or letting slip in general. Early texts also use 漏 for the clepsydra: the Shuowen glosses it as the water clock, where dripping water marks intervals of time; at the summer solstice sixty divisions were counted at midday and forty at night, with the proportions reversed at the winter solstice. The system appears in the Rites of Zhou under the Ministry of Summer’s “Officer in Charge of the Water Jar,” and in the Tang period specialists titled “water clock doctors” were appointed. In Japan, water clocks were instituted from the Tenji era."
