  "explanation": "Originally written 轉, 転 is a phono-semantic compound. The element 車 supplies the idea of the wheel, while 専 (専) functions as the phonetic and also evokes rounding—placing something in a bag (囊) and pounding it with the hand (寸) until it becomes round. Since round things roll easily, the character first pictured wheels turning. From that image it naturally broadened in use to mean turning or revolving, rolling or tumbling, and by extension shifting or changing, coming round or transferring."
