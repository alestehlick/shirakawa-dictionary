  "explanation": "The earliest form was 辠, combining 自, the outline of the nose/face, with 辛, a large tattooing needle, to depict the act of tattooing the face—a penal mark—thus giving the sense of crime. The later graph 罪 uses the net radical and originally pictured a bamboo fishing net, yet already in the Book of Odes and the Analects it appears with the meaning crime. When the Qin unified the script under the First Emperor, 罪 was adopted as the standard form, replacing 辠."
