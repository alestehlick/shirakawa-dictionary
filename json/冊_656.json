  "explanation": "In its earliest form, 冊 depicts wooden stakes sunk into the ground side by side—the original graph for a fence—and thus stands at the root of 柵. The old shape shows slats of uneven length set vertically like a door; some archaic forms even draw a pair of such doors, and bronze inscriptions sometimes place an animal between them, revealing it as the gate of a pen for cattle or sheep. Over time this door-like image came to signify a “volume,” because it resembled bundles of long, narrow bamboo or wooden slips bound together for writing. From there the character took on the senses of writing, document, and book, and today it also serves as the counter for volumes."
