  "explanation": "The character 彰 joins 章 and 彡. 章 depicts tattooing—ink pooling at the tip of a tattooing needle (辛)—and thus conveys the sense of something made distinct and clear. 彡 adds the sheen of color and form, the idea of beauty itself. Within 章, 文 represents the pattern first sketched on the skin, a temporary design (aya). Taken together, 彰 shows beauty made conspicuous—design brought vividly to view—and so comes to mean clear, manifest, and by extension the act of making qualities evident or proclaiming merit."
