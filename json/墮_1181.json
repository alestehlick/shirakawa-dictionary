  "explanation": "墮 is a phono-semantic character built with the phonetic 隋 and the semantic 土, the earth deity’s altar. In Shirakawa’s reading, 隋 itself depicts a ritual scene: 自 is the gods’ ladder for ascent and descent, 左 shows the hand grasping the curse-implement 工, and 月 is a slab of meat. Together they picture meat being set out before the gods’ ladder while the officiant, implement in hand, prays and seeks the gods’ presence. With the on reading da, 隋 comes to signify meat offered in worship. When this is placed at 土, the altar of the earth deity, the offerings are piled up in heaps; from that image of things massing and giving way, 墮 takes on the sense of tumbling down and collapsing. The word later broadened to general notions of falling, crumbling, breaking, and tearing."
