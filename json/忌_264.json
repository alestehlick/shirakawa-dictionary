  "explanation": "忌 is a phono-semantic character: the upper element 己 functions as the phonetic, as in 記, while 心 suggests the sphere of inner feeling. Classical glosses link this word to 誡, the sense of admonition and careful, reverent service to the gods. Its sound also resonates with 跪, “to kneel,” and the graph evokes a body bent and folded in a kneeling posture. From this image it came to express the inward state of awe and self-restraint demanded in ritual—the observance of taboos, purification of oneself, and vigilant care. From the core idea of avoiding defilement, the meanings broadened to “to shun” and, in Japanese, imawashii, an inauspicious or detestable quality."
