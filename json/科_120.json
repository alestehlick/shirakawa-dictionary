  "explanation": "A compound graph of 禾, the grain plant, and 斗, a dry measure, it pictures grain being measured out. From this image of gauging grain came the idea of evaluating and sorting—assigning grades and classes. The sense then broadened to setting standard conditions and the rules or regulations that define them. In Japanese usage it can shade into notions such as shina (quality), hodo (degree or level), and, in legal contexts, toga (fault or charge)."
