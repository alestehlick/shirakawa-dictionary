  "explanation": "A Japanese-made character read komu, 込 evokes people pressing into a space until it is full, or a roadway so congested that one cannot pass freely. By extension it also describes things piling in all at once—work accumulating suddenly, or trouble, effort, and expense mounting together. It stands with other Japanese characters that capture conditions of the road: suberu suggests a sloping way where one slips, 辻 (tsuji) marks a crossroads, and 辿 (tadoru) conveys the arduous progress along a steep mountain path."
