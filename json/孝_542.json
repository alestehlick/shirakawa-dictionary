  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 孝 as a compound: the upper element abbreviates 老, portraying an elder’s long hair in profile, and the lower 子 is “child.” Together they form the image of a child respectfully serving an older person, and so the character comes to mean loving devotion to one’s parents and exemplary service to them. In Zhou-dynasty bronze inscriptions, 孝 commonly denotes diligent service and worship toward the ancestors. From Confucius onward, Confucian thought placed 孝 at the heart of ritual propriety and civilized order, a central ideal later articulated in the Classic of Filial Piety, framed as dialogues between Confucius and his disciple Zengzi."
