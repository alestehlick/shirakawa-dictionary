  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 丙 as a pictograph of a pedestal or stand: the base on which a vessel rests, or the butt end of a lance or staff set firmly on the ground. It is the original graph later used as the phonetic in 柄. In early forms seen in characters such as 商 and 裔, this base functions as a stand for setting a 辛 needle upright or for propping up a weapon or cloth. Its use as the name of the third Heavenly Stem (hinoe) is a phonetic loan based on the On reading hei. Paired with 丁, 丙丁—the third and fourth stems, identified as fire yang and fire yin—evokes the image of a pedestal and a needle. The well-known superstition about women born in a 丙午 (hinoe-uma) year originated in Ming China, spread widely in Japan from the Edo period, and still lingers today."
