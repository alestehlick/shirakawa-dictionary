  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the silk/sign thread element 糸 points to weaving and ornament, while 文 serves as the phonetic that guides the on reading and evokes the idea of marked design. Early lexica such as the Yù Piān (Gyoku Hen) define it as a ryomon, a twilled or diagonal pattern. In Japanese it came to mean the mon, the emblematic crest—seen in monsho, mondokoro, monyo, and kamon—first used as clan devices by the titled classes, then spreading broadly in the Edo period, and, from Meiji onward, adopted by common families as well."
