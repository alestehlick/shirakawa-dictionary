  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 外 as a compound of 夕 and 卜. In the oldest forms, 夕 depicts a piece of flesh (the same idea later written with 月), while 卜 marks divination. In shell-and-bone divination the flesh was stripped from a hard-shelled “outer-boned” turtle to take its plastron for use in the rite, so the meat element evokes killing and scraping away, and 卜 signals the act of divining. Oracle-bone inscriptions even write the Shang king names later transmitted as 外丙 and 外壬 as 卜丙 and 卜壬, showing that 外 originally belonged to the vocabulary of turtle-plastron divination. From that ritual sense the character broadened to mean “outside” in contrast to “inside” (内外), and by extension the exterior or surface, something other or elsewhere, and the verbal sense “to remove, take off.”"
