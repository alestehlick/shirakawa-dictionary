  "explanation": "Originally written 壘, this is a phono-semantic character. The phonetic element 畾—visually evoked by repeated field-like squares—depicts piles of earth-filled sacks, while the earth component points to the material itself. In the oldest conception it shows earth heaped up just as it is, forming the clay embankment of a camp. The Shuowen glosses it as a military wall or fort, capturing the idea of an earthen stronghold. In Japanese the sense broadened to the baseball “base,” as seen in terms like 塁審 and 満塁."
