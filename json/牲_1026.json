  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: the phonetic 生 signals the on reading sei and evokes a living creature, while the semantic element in the earliest oracle-bone forms depicts a sheep rather than an ox. The character denotes the living animal presented in sacrifice—shown alive before the deities and slaughtered only after the offering. Oracle-bone inscriptions record sheep most commonly, alongside oxen and pigs, and, for specific ritual purposes, dogs and horses. After the rite, the animal was portioned out and consumed as sacred food by the participants."
