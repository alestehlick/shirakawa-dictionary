  "explanation": "惜 is a phono-semantic character: the heart element signals a feeling of the mind, while 昔 serves as the phonetic, yielding the on reading seki. The Shuowen glosses it as a hurt or ache of the heart—regret felt as pain—captured in the nuance of deep, grieving reluctance. In Japanese it covers both oshii, “regrettable,” and oshimu, “to spare or begrudge,” yet it also shades into tenderness: older sources explain 惜 as aimu, “to hold dear,” showing how the feeling of regret arises from valuing something. This emotional range appears in compounds such as 惜別 (sekibetsu, the sorrow of parting), 惜陰 (sekiin, lamenting wasted time and urging its careful use), and 惜春 (sekishun, regretting spring’s passing). In Buddhist language, 不惜身命 (fushaku shinmyo) declares a resolve that does not spare even body and life."
