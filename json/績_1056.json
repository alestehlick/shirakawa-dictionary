  "explanation": "績 is a phono-semantic character formed with the silk radical 糸 and 責 as the phonetic, which supplies the on-reading seki. Shirakawa explains 責 as the image of a marker pole (束) set on piles of shell money, indicating goods taken as a levy or tribute. With that base, compounds specify the type of assessed goods: 積 (禾 + 責) for agricultural produce and 績 (糸 + 責) for textiles. Hence 成績 originally meant the proper, rule-bound collection of the textile levy, and by extension the realized results or achievements of one’s efforts. From its thread component, 績 also came to mean ‘to spin, to bring forth thread,’ and further broadened to the senses of ‘merit’ and ‘distinguished deed.’"
