  "explanation": "底 is a phono-semantic character. The element 广 sketches the roof of a building, signaling a structure or dwelling. The phonetic 氐 not only supplies the sound but also evokes the action of planing or chipping a base flat with a handled blade, making an even surface. Together they depict the flattened ground at the foot of a building—the bottom or base upon which one settles and places a roof. From this image, the character naturally came to mean bottom and sole."
