  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: 蔵 (to store, to conceal) supplies the sound zo and the notion of something kept within, while the flesh sign 月 marks a part of the body. Together they form the idea of the organs hidden inside the body. Hence 臓 in compounds such as 内臓 and 臓器 for the internal organs. In traditional classification it designates the five viscera—lungs, heart, spleen, liver, and kidneys—contrasted with the six bowels: large and small intestines, stomach, gallbladder, bladder, and the so‑called triple burner. The core image is of what is stored within the body."
