  "explanation": "In the bronze inscriptions, 奮 combines the elements for garment (衣), a bird (隹), and a device shaped like 田 used to bind the bird’s legs. It pictures a bird confined within clothing, its legs restrained, beating its wings in a bid to break free. From this vivid image arise senses such as fluttering, rousing, and exerting oneself. A related graph, 奪, shows hands reaching to seize a bird about to escape. Here the garment is understood as a funerary robe, and the bird is a bird-shaped spirit embodying the soul of the deceased; enclosing it in the robe was a way to make the soul abide there. The character thus preserves an ancient ritual scene from which its meanings of stirring and mustering effort naturally develop."
