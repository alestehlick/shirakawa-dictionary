  "explanation": "倣 is a phono-semantic character: the person element signals an acting agent, while 放 supplies the sound and the core image. In ancient ritual, 放 depicted a body suspended from a horizontal beam and struck with potent force to stir the spirit and drive away malign influences. From this rite arose the idea of making something conform or become like something else, so 放 came to carry the sense of imitating or rendering similar. With that nuance taken as its base, 倣 means to imitate, to follow a model, as seen in compounds such as 模倣, 依倣, and 倣効."
