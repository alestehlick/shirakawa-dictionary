  "explanation": "This character began as a pictograph of a person kneeling beneath a deep ceremonial cap, receiving a divine message. It therefore signifies a revelation from the gods and, by extension, the edict or command issued by the Son of Heaven or other superiors. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions 令 is used in the sense later written as 命, and indeed served as the original graph for 命. From the notion of heeding the divine will it also developed the meaning “good, fine,” and in Japanese it further came to function with the causative force seen in -shimu, eventually being used independently apart from 命."
