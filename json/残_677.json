  "explanation": "Originally written 殘, this is a phono-semantic character. The semantic element is 歹, an ancient form depicting the upper part of a human skeleton—bones that are left behind. The phonetic element 戔 shows pikes (戈) heaped up in thin, small layers, and lends the on-reading while also suggesting a piling, fragmenting action. Together they evoke the few dismembered bones that remain after violent cutting or devouring. From this image arise the senses “to remain, to be left,” and by extension “to spoil, to harm,” and “cruel,” as seen in compounds like 残虐 and 残酷, which picture the aftermath of scattered remains."
