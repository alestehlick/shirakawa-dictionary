  "explanation": "This character is a compound graph. In its older, full form 國, it places 或 inside an enclosing border. 或 originally shows a city wall with a halberd (戈), evoking a territory defended by arms; encircled by the outer wall, it came to mean the fortified seat of power and then, more broadly, a country. Once 或 later developed the separate meaning “or,” the enclosure clarified the sense of a guarded domain. In the Tang, Empress Wu Zetian replaced 或 with 八方 (“all directions”) to create the variant 圀, a form still seen in names such as Tokugawa Mitsukuni (徳川光圀). The modern standard form 国 is an abbreviation that arose from the cursive (grass-script) writing of 國."
