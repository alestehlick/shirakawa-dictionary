  "explanation": "泉 is a pictograph of water spilling down from a cliff face, the vivid image of a spring welling up to become a stream or river. The Shuowen already glosses it as water and by extension as a fountainhead, a spring, and spring water. When the cliff form 厂 is added to 泉, it yields 原, a graph likewise expressing the idea of an origin or source. The on reading sen matches that of 銭, and in Wang Mang’s coinage the term 貨泉 appeared; on some coins the inscription was artfully divided, rendering 泉 as the components 白 and 水 and splitting 貨 into 眞 and 人."
