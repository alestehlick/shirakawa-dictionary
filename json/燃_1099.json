  "explanation": "燃 combines the fire radical 火 with 然. In 然, the elements 月 (an abbreviated form of flesh) and 犬 depict dog meat set out as a sacrificial offering; with fire applied, it shows the meat being roasted so that its fragrance rises to the heavens. In ancient rites, dogs and rice were offered to the supreme deity, and the pleasing aroma of the roasting was sent upward in prayer. From this base, 然 later came to be used phonetically for adverbial senses like “thus” and “however,” while the form with the added fire was fixed for the concrete sense of “to burn,” “to roast,” or “to broil.” In this way, 燃 expresses burning in the physical, combustible sense."
