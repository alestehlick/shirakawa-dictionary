  "explanation": "宿 is a compound graph built from the roof radical 宀 and a figure of a person lying on a mat, evoking a vigil kept through the night beneath the roof of an ancestral mausoleum. From this sacred scene of night watch the character came to mean lodging and dwelling—yadoru “to lodge,” yado “an inn,” and by extension a temporary stay. In ritual usage, 宿る also described remaining in seclusion to observe abstinence before a ceremony. The sense of something that ‘stays on’ then widened to what is long held or long continued: long-cherished vows and intentions (宿願, 宿志), people seasoned in learning (宿学, 宿儒), and influences that linger, such as an old grudge (宿恨) or a hangover that remains (宿酔). All derive from the original image of keeping presence through the night under a sacred roof."
