  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats 査 as a phono-semantic character: the component 且 serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading sa, while the graph originally appeared as 楂, the name of a tree identified with a small Japanese quince. That tree-name graph could also stand in place of 槎 and even carry the sense of “raft.” From these early concrete usages, its meaning broadened: the Ming-era Zhengzitong already glossed it in the vein of 察, “to consider and examine,” and today it is used in the sense “to investigate, examine.”"
