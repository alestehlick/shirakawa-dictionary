  "explanation": "In its earliest forms, 文 depicts the tattoo or body painting placed on the chest of a front‑facing figure. Such designs—shapes like a heart, cross, or chevron—were painted in fresh cinnabar on the bodies of the dead as potent ritual adornment: charms to keep the soul from slipping away, ward off intrusive spirits, and pray for revival. From this sacred practice, 文 came to signify a beautifully adorned figure or pattern, coloring and decoration. Related characters preserve this ritual background: 産 portrays rites surrounding birth; 彥 combines 文 with a brow mark and hairlines to show the coming‑of‑age tattoo on the forehead of a youth; 爽, 爾, and 奭 depict vivid vermilion motifs set symmetrically on the breasts, hence senses like clarity, brightness, and beauty (爾 being the bust portion of 爽). Characters that add 彡 underscore the luster and elegance of such body decoration. 章 represents the ink‑charged tip of a tattoo needle; paired with 文 it yields 文章, which extends the idea of patterned adornment to the realm of composed expression, and through 文字 to the notions of characters, writing, and words."
