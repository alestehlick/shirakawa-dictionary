  "explanation": "In its original form 專, the character combines 惠, the image of a tied sack filled with goods, and 寸, the hand. It depicts putting things into the sack and pounding and compressing them by hand until they gather into a single mass, which gave early senses like “to roll up” and “to pound together.” From this core image, related graphs develop: 團 (団) shows the contents compacted within an enclosure into a rounded whole; 摶 expresses shaping by hand into a ball; 塼 names earth pressed and fired into a brick or tile. By extension—doing nothing but pounding and packing—the character came to mean “solely, exclusively,” and from there “to monopolize, to concentrate.”"
