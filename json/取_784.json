  "explanation": "取 combines the ear (耳) with a hand (又), picturing the ancient battlefield custom of cutting off a slain enemy’s left ear as proof of the kill and bringing it back to be counted for military merit. From this concrete act of taking an ear, the character broadened to the general sense “to take,” further shading into “to seize, to rob,” and even “to take a wife.” Related graphs preserve this background: there are characters that explicitly mean “to cut off the ear” and “to cut off the head,” while 最 shows the sense of covering over a heap when many ears have been gathered, and 撮 depicts pinching and taking with the fingers; even 聚 likely began with the idea of collecting severed ears."
