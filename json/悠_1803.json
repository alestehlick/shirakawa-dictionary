  "explanation": "悠 is a phono-semantic character with 攸 as its phonetic. In ancient form, 攸 shows water being poured to wash a person’s back—a scene of ritual purification—so it carries the sense of cleansing. With the heart/mind element, the character comes to express the condition after such ablutions: a spirit calmed, loosened, and unhurried. From this it naturally yields meanings like gentle, tranquil, and leisurely, and by extension the ideas of distance and long duration, as in 悠遠 (remote) and 悠久 (enduring). A further nuance of sustained contemplation, seen in expressions like 悠思, also fostered associations with grieving; the Shuowen even glosses it with 憂, “to grieve.”"
