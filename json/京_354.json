  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 京 as a pictograph of a grand fortress gate with an arched passage and a lookout tower above. The profile of this gate is visible in the oracle-bone and bronze forms. Because such a monumental gate guarded the inner city, the character came to mean the capital and, by extension, something great or large. The term keikan (京観) evokes this imposing gate. In ancient ritual practice, the gate itself could serve as a powerful apotropaic boundary: remains from the battlefield were sealed into the structure to form a curse barrier, much as temple sanmon gates later marked a threshold against the outer world."
