  "explanation": "Originally written 讓, this is a phono‑semantic character pairing 言 “words” with the phonetic 襄. Shirakawa reads 襄 as the image of a corpse’s collar adorned with two ritual containers (sai) and four ‘curse tools’ set there to ward off invading spirits, so it carries the sense of exorcising, purifying, and of urging or reproaching. With 言, the graph points to forceful, purifying words used to drive away malign forces. Related characters such as 攘 and the compound 攘斥 speak of purifying and repelling, while 禳 denotes apotropaic purification; in ancient China a rite called 磔禳 hung a dog’s skin at a fortress gate to avert harm, akin to Japan’s oniyarai. From this core idea of driving back and yielding ground, the meaning broadened to “hand over,” “cede,” and, by extension, “be modest.”"
