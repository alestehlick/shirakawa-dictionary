  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats 潔 as a phono-semantic character built on 絜 (ketsu) as its phonetic. The underlying graph evokes a thread ornament used in worship—finely split hemp bound into bundles like white hair—prepared by thinly cutting with a knife (刀). Because such ornaments were employed in rites of purification, the base graph carried the sense of purifying. With the water element added, 潔 specifies purification by washing, hence “to cleanse, to purify,” and by extension “pure, clean,” which in Japanese usage also shades into the forthright, stainless quality expressed by isagiyoi."
