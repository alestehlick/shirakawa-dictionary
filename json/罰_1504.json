  "explanation": "罰 is a compound graph built from the component 詈—depicting a net laid over words—and the knife radical 刀. 詈 shows the words of a solemn oath symbolically covered and rendered void by a net; with the addition of a knife, the image becomes one of cutting that oath to pieces. The character thus originally signifies tearing up and annulling an oath made to the gods, and by extension the blame and chastisement visited upon those who lie before the divine. The Book of Documents (Speech of Tang) uses the phrase 致天之罰, “to carry out Heaven’s punishment,” reflecting 罰 in its first sense as Heaven’s retribution; only later did it broaden to denote legal penalties imposed on offenders."
