  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 難 as a compound whose bronze-script form depicts a short-tailed bird (zui/‘tori’) being shot with a fire-tipped arrow. This striking image conveys the idea of startling and harrying a bird—hence the senses of afflicting, plaguing, and being troubled. He connects the scene to the exorcistic rite 儺 (oni-yarai), where bird-related divination played a role in averting misfortune. From this core of ‘to distress’ the character broadened to mean calamity and, by extension, difficulty or hardness."
