  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 嫡 as a phono-semantic compound. Its phonetic core is 啇 (teki), a graph that originally joined 帝—the great altar used to worship the Heavenly Emperor—with 口 understood here as a sai, a covenant vessel that held written petitions to the gods. In the ancient forms this composition points to the great ancestral rite 禘, the worship of the Heavenly Emperor. Because only those in the direct line were permitted to perform the 禘祭, 啇 came to signify an heir or successor. With 女 added as the semantic element, the character turns to matters of household status: the principal, lawful wife and, by extension, the legitimate heir. In this way 嫡 preserves the religious authority of the ancestral rite while expressing rightful succession within the family."
