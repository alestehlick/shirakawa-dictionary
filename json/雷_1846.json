  "explanation": "In the bronze inscriptions, this character is a pictograph of lightning bursting forth. The later standard form puts the rain radical on top and uses 田 as a compact shorthand for the jagged flashes, following the convention that celestial and weather phenomena take the rain header, as in 雲 (cloud) and 雪 (snow). Thus 雷 came to write thunder. The booming of thunder was likened to drumbeats, and Han-period brick paintings portray the thunder god (Leishen/Raijin) striking drums to summon the peal—an image that conveys the character’s sound and force."
