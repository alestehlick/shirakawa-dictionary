  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 名 as a compound of 夕 and 口. Here 夕 is an abbreviated form of 肉, the meat offered in ancestral rites, while 口 depicts the sacred covenant vessel (sai) into which written prayers to the gods were placed. When a newborn survived its first vulnerable days, a rite was held in the ancestral mausoleum: meat was presented, a prayer proclaiming the child’s growth was recited, and at that moment the child received a 名. From this ritual act came the senses “name” and “to name,” and by extension the idea of publicly acknowledged “reputation” or “fame,” as in 名声 and 名望. In the same tradition, one first received a childhood name (幼名), and later, at another temple rite, underwent formal naming (命名); to avoid uttering the personal name, a courtesy name (字, azana) was adopted, often chosen in deliberate relation to the given 名 and used as the ordinary, everyday name."
