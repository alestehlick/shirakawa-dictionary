  "explanation": "The original form is 齊, depicting three hairpins of equal length set in the hair. In bronze inscriptions, these three pins are shown gathered at the forehead, emphasizing their matched, orderly arrangement. From this image arise the senses of being equal, in accord, and well-regulated—things that match and line up. The three hairpins evoke the ceremonial coiffure of a wife serving at ritual occasions. When the altar sign 示 is added, the character becomes 斎, shifting the scene explicitly to the sacred setting and giving rise to meanings of ritual purification and abstention in reverent service."
