  "explanation": "賓 combines 宀, the roof of an ancestral mausoleum, with 万, the hind leg of an animal prepared for sacrifice, and 貝, a shell used as a ritual implement. The graph pictures bringing a sacrificial hind leg together with a shell into the mausoleum as part of a rite to invite and welcome the gods. From this ceremony of receiving a visiting deity—a guest god from elsewhere—the meaning broadened to human guests and to the act of treating and entertaining them. The same reading hin appears in 殯, “lying in state,” which likewise belongs to the sphere of ancestral and funerary rites."
