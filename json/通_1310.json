  "explanation": "通 is a phono-semantic character built from 甬 and 辵 (辶). The element 甬, also seen as the phonetic in 痛, originally depicts a bucket—a hollow, tube-like vessel—and supplies both the sound and the image of a cylindrical passage. 辵 conveys the act of going or walking. Together they express the idea of moving through a hollow space, passing smoothly without obstruction. From this core sense arise broader uses: to pass through, to go back and forth, to reach and pervade, and by extension to be widespread or universal."
