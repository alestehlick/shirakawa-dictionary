  "explanation": "A late phono-semantic formation, 拐 pairs the hand radical with a phonetic element associated with 掛 and 卦, which underlies its on reading kai. It does not appear in the oldest dictionaries and seems to have been coined after the Tang period. The character took hold in compounds such as 誘拐, “to lure and carry someone away.” A vivid historical image preserves its core sense: in the Song era, Yue Fei was said to charge enemy lines using three horses bound together with reed rope, a formation called 拐子馬, the “abductor horse,” evoking the act of taking or drawing something along. From this basic idea of carrying off, the usage broadened to include deceiving or swindling."
