  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: 女 supplies the semantic ground of kinship—originally suggesting groups traced through the maternal line—while 生, the picture of a sprouting plant, provides the sound sei and the idea of birth. 姓 thus names those “born of the same blood,” a lineage or kin group. As such blood ties broadened, they formed larger associations that shared a common surname. In Zhou times, for example, the royal house bore the 姬 (Ji) surname. Shirakawa also distinguishes 姓 from 氏: 氏 depicts the knife used to carve sacrificial meat and denotes those who participate together in the communal rituals and feasts after ancestor worship, whereas 姓 marks a group united by descent from the same ancestors. This sense of 姓 is not the same as the ancient Japanese kabane system."
