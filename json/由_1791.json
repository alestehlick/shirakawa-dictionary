  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats 由 as a pictograph of a calabash vessel whose seeds have fully ripened and dissolved away, leaving the rind hollow—an image of an emptied interior. The graph closely resembles 卣, the bronze wine cask, and likely arose from that vessel type. From this core picture of a hollowed container, related characters took shape: 油 evokes the oily state of ripened gourd seeds, 軸 suggests a hollow core that lets an axle turn, and 抽 expresses drawing out or extracting what has ripened and become oily. On this base the graph also lent its sound to meanings such as “to be due to” and “reason,” reflected in Japanese usage like yoshi in reported statements or in phrases meaning “without reason.”"
