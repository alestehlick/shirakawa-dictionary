  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 王 as a pictograph of a large broadax head. The fully equipped broadax with its handle is written 戊 (etsu, “broadax”). In ritual, the ax-head—its blade turned downward—was set before the ruler’s jade seat, not as a weapon but as a ceremonial emblem proclaiming royal authority. From this emblem the character came to mean lord and ruler. By contrast, 士 shows a smaller ax-head placed in the same downward posture, marking the rank of the warrior class; the difference between 王 and 士 lies in the size of the broadax depicted."
