  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 使 as a picto‑phonetic character with 史 supplying the on‑reading shi. In the oracle‑bone and bronze scripts, 史 and 使 are essentially the same figure: a covenant vessel (sai) fastened to a tall, forked wooden staff held aloft in the hand during state rites for ancestral spirits. When envoys set out to the provinces to offer sacrifices to mountains and rivers, they carried this ritual staff fitted with the covenant receptacle and streamers. Thus 使 first meant an envoy or messenger and, by extension, the act of dispatching one, later broadening to the general sense of using people or things. The same ritual scene also lies behind 事, whose early graph matches those of 史 and 使."
