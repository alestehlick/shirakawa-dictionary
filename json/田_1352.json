  "explanation": "A pictograph of a field divided into plots. In oracle-bone script a single plot is drawn as a rectangle, while in bronze inscriptions it settles into a neat square. Bronze evidence suggests 田 denoted roughly the area a single man could cultivate, hence its core sense of “field” and, by extension, “to till a paddy field.” In the oracle inscriptions, however, it often stands for “hunting, chase,” a usage still found in the Book of Odes and the Book of Documents; later, that hunting sense came to be written with 畋."
