  "explanation": "This character combines 又, the right hand, with 月, the form of flesh or sacrificial meat. It originally portrays taking the offering meat in one’s hand and presenting it to the gods, hence the earliest sense of making an offering. From that concrete act of holding and presenting came the generalized meanings “to hold,” “to keep,” and ultimately “to have” and “to exist.” It is the original graph of 侑, associated with urging or presenting food. In oracle-bone inscriptions the hand element 又 is often used alone to write the sense “to have,” while in bronze inscriptions both 有 and 在 appear in contexts of possession and existence."
