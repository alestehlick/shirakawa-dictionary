  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 歌 as a phono-semantic character. Its phonetic is 哥 (ka), a doubling of 可. 可 portrays striking the covenant vessel (sai), into which petitions to the gods were placed, with a stick (丁) to press the gods to grant the request—hence its senses of “it should” and “it is permitted.” The semantic is 欠, a figure with mouth open in vocalization. In ritual prayer this urging became rhythmic, and 歌 names the melody of that insistent voice, coming to mean both “to sing” and “song.” He even links the native uta to utsu “to beat” and uttau “to press a plea.” Related words refine the nuance: 詠 suggests a drawn-out, sustained style; 歌 the forceful singing that presses one’s petition; 謡 (artistic song) evokes singing while offering meat to coax the gods; and 唱 denotes choral chanting. An older form is 謌."
