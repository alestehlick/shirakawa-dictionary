  "explanation": "A pictograph of the heart, regarded in antiquity as the source of life and the seat of thought. Although the character itself does not appear in oracle-bone inscriptions, the oracle-bone form of 文 shows chest markings on a front-facing human figure, an emblem pointing to the heart. By the bronze inscription period, 心 is attested with moral and mental nuance, as in 敬明乃心, “Let your heart be made clear through reverence,” already expressing heart as mind, consideration, and the place where virtue takes root. The Japanese word kokoro originally evoked a “coagulating place,” where feelings and intentions gather and take form."
