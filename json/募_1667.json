  "explanation": "募 is a phonetic–semantic character formed from 莫 above 力. 莫 functions as the phonetic, signaling the on-reading bo, and also resonates with the sense of 摸, to seek or take broadly, implying a wide-ranging call. The lower 力, understood here as the form of a plow, evokes agricultural labor. Together they depict calling for and gathering people—originally recruiting hands for farm work—and by extension came to mean to recruit, solicit, or raise support."
