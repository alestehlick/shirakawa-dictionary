  "explanation": "握 is a phono-semantic character: the hand element signals a hand action, and 屋 serves as the phonetic, yielding the on reading aku and linking it to related graphs such as 幄 and 渥. Originally, 屋 depicted a compact boarded chamber used for the temporary laying-out of the dead (殯), and so it carries the sense of something made tight and small. In 握 this tightly enclosed nuance combines with the image of the fingers bent inward to express closing the hand firmly around something—the basic sense of nigiru, to clasp or clench. The companion graph 渥, in the same phonetic family, denotes thorough wetting and a warm, ample heart, reinforcing the idea of fullness and completeness that suits a strong, secure grip."
