  "explanation": "A pictograph of a human child distinguished by an infant’s hairstyle. As described in the Book of Rites (Nei Ze), boys received the “male-horn” style three months after birth; the ancient form 兒 depicts this agemaki: the hair is parted down the middle and bound into ring-like tufts by the ears that jut out like small horns. A similar outline was imagined for the “female rainbow” 霓, seen as a two‑headed dragon whose twin heads recall an infant’s hornlike buns. From this vivid image the character naturally came to mean “child, infant.”"
