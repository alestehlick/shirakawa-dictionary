  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 流 as a compound formed from two instances of water and the graph 夼 (totsu), which depicts a child with disheveled hair held upside down. Together they picture an infant swept along in a river, giving the core senses “to flow, be carried away,” and, by extension, “to let flow, to pour.” Related water graphs finely distinguish what the current does: 氾 marks a drowned body floating face-down, 泛 floating face-up, while 浮 shows the act of trying to lift a fallen child from above. He also notes an ancient custom in which a newborn might be briefly set adrift before a decision to raise it—an unsettling practice that nonetheless clarifies the character’s imagery. From the idea of those borne along together, 流 further came to signify a circle or lineage, as in meiryū (名流), a “celebrity” counted among a distinguished set."
