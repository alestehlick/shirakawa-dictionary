  "explanation": "Originally written as 畫, the character combines 聿, a writing brush, with 田, which in early script represents 周—a square shield. 画 thus evokes the act of drawing or inscribing designs upon that shield, and by extension the picture or pattern itself. The 周 shield was a square divided by a cross and engraved with patterned fields; such shields, to which departing troops would attach a ritual sai vessel holding written prayers to the gods, served as objects of solemn vow. From the frequent depiction of these compartmented shield patterns arose the sense of marking off or partitioning (区画). Historically, 劃 was the character used specifically for “to divide/mark off,” while in usage 画 takes the on reading ga for the picture/drawing sense, and kaku for the senses of limiting, dividing, or measuring."
