  "explanation": "Shirakawa traces this character back to the older graph 劂, which shows a knife being held into an open hearth for forging. Through that process the blade becomes keen and robust, so the word comes to mean both sharp and strong. The later form 銳 (modern 鋭) is a semantic–phonetic compound: the metal radical signals a metal blade, while 兌 serves as the phonetic element that gives the on reading ei."
