  "explanation": "This graph began as the picture of a footprint—one form for the right step, another for the left. It is the upper element of 歩, which depicts left and right steps alternating to show walking. From the sense of pressing strength into the legs and impressing a firm step, 止 came to mean to stop, stay, or remain. By adding the foot/leg classifier 足 to 止, scribes created 趾, the character for a footprint, with 止 as the original graph and 趾 as its semantic elaboration. In oracle-bone and turtle-plastron inscriptions, the forms for 止 and 之 are alike, both tracing a single step to indicate leg movement; 之 developed the meaning to go or advance, and its later use as the pronoun this is a loan application."
