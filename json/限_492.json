  "explanation": "Limits are pictured here through a sacred threshold. The left element 阝 (from 阜) originally depicts the ladder by which deities ascend and descend between heaven and earth—a holy place that must be protected. At that approach an apotropaic eye 目, a curse eye set to repel evil, is installed, and beneath it stands 匕, the figure of a person turning away. The whole character thus shows someone forced to turn back under the warding eye at the divine approach, where further advance is barred. From this image comes the sense of setting bounds and not permitting passage—hence “to limit” and “limit.”"
