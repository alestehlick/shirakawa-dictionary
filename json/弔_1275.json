  "explanation": "In its earliest guise, 弔 is a pictograph of the cord of a throwing javelin coiled around a bow—the tethered dart that, when cast, twists around and catches birds. Over time, the dedicated graph 繳 came to represent the sense “javelin cord,” and 弔, from the Warring States period onward, was used for “to mourn, to offer condolences.” Forms understood as combining a person with a bow recall an old funerary scene: after leaving the dead exposed to weather, people would later go to collect the bones, carrying a bow to drive off wild animals—an act that naturally came to signify mourning the departed. A phonetic link also colors its usage: the on-reading associated with 繳 (zhuo/shaku) aligns with 淑 (shu/shuku, “good”), so 弔 could bear the nuance of being in favor or not. This helps explain phrases like 不弔 in the Book of Odes as “ill-starred, not granted Heaven’s aid,” that is, misfortune."
