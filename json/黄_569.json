  "explanation": "In the earliest oracle-bone forms, this character depicts a fire arrow—an arrow shot alight—whose glow suggested the color “yellow.” In bronze inscriptions the figure shifts to the outline of girdle pendants (peiyu), jade ornaments hung from a leather belt at the waist; some forms clearly show the side-hanging, arc-shaped jade known as huang. The graph 黄 thus came to resemble a set of such combined pendants, and their warm, light-brown sheen was taken as the hue called “yellow.” Within the Five Agents doctrine, yellow was the color of the center and thus came to be compared with the imperial position, giving rise to usages like 黄門, the “yellow” (that is, palace) gate."
