  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the person radical 亻 points to people and social life, while 谷 serves as the phonetic element—not the “koku” of ravines, but the value heard in 容, 欲, and 浴. In 容, 谷 depicts a covenant vessel set within the ancestral shrine, over which the numinous presence of the gods is sensed; 欲 originally voiced the wish to behold that epiphany. In bronze inscriptions 俗 is even used with the sense of 欲, showing their closeness. From this ritual background, 俗 came to denote the shared norms shaped by communal belief—the customary etiquette and ways of society—and by extension what is ordinary, worldly, and at times vulgar."
