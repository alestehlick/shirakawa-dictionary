  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 嘱 as a phono-semantic character whose original form is 囑. The element 口 signals speech, while 属 serves as the phonetic and also carries the sense of an ongoing attachment. He analyzes 属 as a graph formed from parts representing a female and a male animal in mutual cohabitation, hence the idea of being linked and continuing together. With 目 added, the related character 矚 means to keep one’s eyes fixed and attend closely; with 口, 嘱 turns that sustained attention into spoken direction—telling someone what to do so that it will be carried out. From this it comes to mean to charge or order a task and to entrust it (tanomu, yudaneru), with the On reading shoku."
