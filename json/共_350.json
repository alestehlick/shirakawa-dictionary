  "explanation": "共 goes back to a figure of two hands set side by side, built on the hand-sign 廾, showing both hands holding up various offerings. In early forms it depicts those hands respectfully raising a ritual implement used in divine ceremonies, an image that gives the character a tone of reverent restraint and deference—senses that later nourish the character 恭. From the fact that the act is performed with left and right hands together, the meaning “together, in common” naturally arises. The same two-handed offering stance also stands behind 供, “to offer, to provide.”"
