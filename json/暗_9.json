  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 暗 as a phono-semantic character in the 音 series, with 音 supplying the on reading an. Its older expression is 闇, which shows a sound issuing within the double doors 門 of a household shrine. Petitionary writings (言)—a graph formed from 辛, the tattooing needle of oath-punishment, and a receptacle for the covenant text—were placed before the gods and vows were made. In the night the vessel holding these writings emitted a sound that revealed the deities’ response; that answering sound is what 音 depicts. 闇 thus conveys the experience of hearing the nocturnal visitation of the gods at the shrine, and from those indistinct night sounds both 闇 and 暗 came to denote “dark” and “darkness.”"
