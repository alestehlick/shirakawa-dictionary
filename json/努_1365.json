  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: 奴 supplies the sound do, while 力—seen here as the form of a plow—points to agricultural labor. From its graphic makeup, the character evokes a servant working diligently in the fields. In an age without machines, cultivating the soil and producing one’s livelihood demanded doryoku: unremitting, assiduous effort. The related graph 怒 expresses fierce emotion; that same intensity was felt necessary for earnest striving. In time, the sense broadened beyond farming to mean simply to strive and make an effort."
