  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 高 as a compound built from an abbreviated form of 京 and an enclosing element used here as sai, a sacred receptacle for covenantal prayer slips. In archaic depiction, 京 shows the arched entrance and exit of the capital’s great fortress gate, surmounted by a watchtower. The whole graph pictures presenting written prayers at that imposing gate to purify the threshold and keep malign forces from entering. Because the gate is crowned by a high lookout, the character naturally came to mean high, tall, and great, and by extension a high place or rank and, in a spiritual sense, refined nobility—sensed in contrasts like 高低 and in words such as 高尚."
