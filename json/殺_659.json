  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 殺 as a compound graph: on the left stands the figure of a curse-bearing animal, marked by a small dot for its ear, and on the right 殳, the long-handled pike (an elongated戈). The scene shows striking down the animal that has brought a curse, thereby weakening and neutralizing its baneful power. From this, the original sense is to lessen or blunt a harmful influence—hence uses like gensai “to reduce”—and only subsequently did it come to mean simply “to kill.” In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions the character is written with just the animal figure, a usage later seen with 蔡 for “to kill.”"
