  "explanation": "This is a picto-phonetic character. The phonetic element 彥 (彦) depicts a forehead (厂) ornamented with ritual body paint 文, with 彡 suggesting the sheen and beauty of the decoration; it conveys both sound and the notion of a handsome, adorned youth. The semantic component 頁 shows the head in profile as in solemn worship. Brought together, they picture the face of a young man at a coming-of-age ceremony, his brow finely painted for the rite—hence the meaning “face.”"
