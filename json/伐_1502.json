  "explanation": "In its earliest forms, 伐 combines the person element with the halberd 戈, picturing the act of striking down and cutting off a person’s head. From this vivid image arise the senses of striking, cutting, and beheading. Oracle-bone inscriptions record queries such as “伐三十羌,” asking whether a set number of Qiang people should be killed, and Shang royal tombs contain many separately buried heads in groups of ten, likely Qiang victims offered as sacrificial offerings. Rooted in this martial and sacrificial context, 伐 came to signify punitive attack and subjugation. The compound 伐旌 referred to the bestowal of military honors and fostered later uses meaning to display one’s merits and to boast of them."
