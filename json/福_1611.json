  "explanation": "福 combines 示, the sign of the ritual altar, with a phonetic element depicting a vessel swollen like a brimming wine barrel (畐/冨), which also supplies the sound fuku. The character thus evokes setting a full wine vessel before the gods to petition for happiness. Bronze inscriptions even show a form with a roof-like element above this vessel, pointing to the ancestral mausoleum where such offerings were made, and where good fortune was believed to be granted in response. By extension, 福 can refer to sacrificial fare and offerings—himorogi, such as meat or rice—set out for the deities. The phrase 致福 describes the custom of dividing these offerings among one’s kin or clan: sharing what has been offered signifies receiving the gods’ favor and bounty, the 福禄 bestowed through the rite."
