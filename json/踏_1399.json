  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the foot radical marks the act of stepping, while the phonetic 沓 (read tou) carries an older ritual nuance. Shirakawa explains 沓 as combining the sign of water with a figure of a ritual container that held written prayers; pouring water over it defiled the vessel and annulled the prayer’s power. In some early sources the form uses 易 as the phonetic, understood as the inversion of 習—where 習 denotes rubbing to quicken a prayer’s efficacy, its inversion conveys the canceling of that efficacy. Within this frame, 踏 (and related 蹋) depicts treading not only as a physical step but as a deliberate, defiling stamp—trampling to suppress. In antiquity, such treading was a magical act performed to pacify earth spirits, and Chinese folk custom preserved various rites centered on ritual stepping."
