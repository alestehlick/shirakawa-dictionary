  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 魅 as a phono-semantic character: 未 functions as the phonetic, signaling the on reading mi, while the body is 鬼, the ghost-demon. Early forms also incorporate the hair-strokes 彡, emblem of a thickly haired, uncanny being—much like the long‑haired monster implied in 彪—evoking mononoke and sudama, spirits thought to dwell in mountains, forests, trees, and stones. In Zhou and old-script shapes, the lower element is animal-like and approaches the form of 祟 “curse,” suggesting a dread apparition feared for bringing calamity. From this image of a bewitching presence that seizes the heart arose the later sense of enthralling or leading the mind astray, as reflected in compounds such as 魅了, 魅力, and 魅惑."
