  "explanation": "板 is a phono-semantic character: the wood element supplies the meaning, while 反 serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on reading han. Bronze inscriptions depict a hand wielding an axe against a tree, vividly expressing the act of chipping off a slab—hence the core sense of a thin board or plank. Although the Shuowen does not record 板, the Yù Piān defines it as “a piece of wood, the same as 版,” implying that 板 and 版 were originally the same graph. In early usage they often substitute for one another, which is why the term for a woodblock used in printing can appear as either 版木 or 板木."
