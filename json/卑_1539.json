  "explanation": "卑 shows a hand (又) holding a spoon with a handle. In contrast to 卓, which depicts a large ladle and so came to mean “to excel” and “high,” 卑 portrays a small spoon and thus takes on senses of being low, small, and humble—hence “mean” or “lowly,” and by extension “to humble oneself.” From this core idea of lowness come derivatives such as 婢, “maidservant,” and 陴, “low fence,” which preserve the sense of something set lower or placed in a subordinate position."
