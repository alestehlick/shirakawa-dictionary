  "explanation": "In the oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, this character shows four counting rods stacked for calculation, a simple indicative sign meaning “four.” Because such piles of lines could look irregular when written, the later standardized form came to lean on a phonetic loan: it adopted the on-reading shi from a graph depicting an open mouth letting out breath or laughing, and the character was used with that borrowed sound. In formal and financial contexts, 肆 was employed as the numeral for “four” to prevent alteration."
