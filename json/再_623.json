  "explanation": "In its earliest, pictographic form, 再 depicts the act of braiding. A horizontal stroke represents the cord, and the element 冉—understood as the braiding implement—is placed above and below to show the worker turning the strand back and continuing the weave. This visual of doubling back naturally gives the meaning “again,” and by extension suggests “two,” the second pass of the braid. The same idea of assembling is seen in the related graph 冓, formed by putting 冉 at both top and bottom, which means “to put together.”"
