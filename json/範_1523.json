  "explanation": "範 is a phono-semantic character. Its phonetic element (han/fan) points to an ancient rite: the purification of military chariots at the army’s departure, in which a dog was run over beneath the yoke to avert impurity. Classical sources such as the Shuowen already gloss 範 as this chariot-purification ceremony. From the associated sense of covering from above, 範 (also written 笵) came to mean a mold or form—specifically, a mold made of bamboo that is covered from above—complementing 模, a corresponding form made from wood. From this concrete “mold” arose the abstract meanings of pattern, model, and norm, as seen in compounds like 模範, and by extension the idea of a rule or law."
