  "explanation": "A compound of 言, “words, declarations,” and 殳, which in early form depicts a feathered ritual implement. Early glosses take it as “to provide and set in line,” originally referring to laying out ritual vessels. Although not attested in oracle-bone or bronze inscriptions, the components point to a scene in which words of oath (言) are ritually purified and ordered with the feathered emblem (殳) before the gods. From this solemn act of arranging and presenting, the character broadened to the general senses of setting up, providing, arranging, and placing."
