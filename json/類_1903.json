  "explanation": "In its original form, 類 combines 米 “rice,” 犬 “dog,” and 頁, which here portrays a figure in formal posture, hair bound and crowned for ritual. The graph pictures a worshipper, ceremonially attired and bowing, presenting rice and a dog as a sacrificial offering in a festival directed to Heaven. In rites to the Supreme Deity, the dog was roasted so that its fragrance would rise to the sky—a sense reflected in the Book of Documents, Shun Canon: 肆類于上帝, “he offered a special類-sacrifice to the Highest.” Later standardization replaced the dog component 犬 with the human figure 大, obscuring the original act of canine sacrifice, and the character broadened in use to mean “to be alike” and “kind, sort.” When the altar sign 示 is added to this graph, it yields 禷 (read rui), preserving the older, specifically ritual meaning of worship."
