  "explanation": "This character combines the rabbit 兔 (兎) with the movement radical 辵 (辶)—itself formed from 彳, a small path, and 止, the shape of a footprint—to express motion. The image of a rabbit bounding away underlies its early senses: to slip off, escape, or hide, and by extension to be swift. From that core it further came to suggest what rises above the ordinary—surpassing or excelling—and, in classical usage, it can also stand for the idea of ease and enjoyment in place of 佚."
