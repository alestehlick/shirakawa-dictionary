  "explanation": "A Japanese-made character, 匁 names the monme, defined as one-thousandth of a kan (貫)—about 3.75 grams, or 0.132 ounces. In the Edo period it also served as a monetary benchmark: in Keicho 14 (1609) the shogunate equated one ryo of gold with fifty monme of silver, and in Genroku 14 (1701) with sixty monme. The term appears as 文目 (monme), with 文 indicating a measure of length and 目 (“me”) a unit of weight, and it is sometimes referred to simply as me."
