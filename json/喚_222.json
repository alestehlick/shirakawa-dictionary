  "explanation": "喚 is a phono-semantic character: the mouth component marks speech or voice, while 奐 supplies the sound and originally pictured a person lifting a newborn with both hands as it emerges from an animal with thighs parted. Related expressions such as 涣然 evoke the vigor and clarity of childbirth, and 奎 likewise names the smooth delivery of a lamb, in line with the sense of 達, “to pass through,” for a birth that proceeds unimpeded. From this imagery, 喚 comes to denote the loud cry at the moment of birth, and by extension the acts of calling out and screaming."
