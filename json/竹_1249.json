  "explanation": "This graph is a pictograph of bamboo, showing the leaves hanging down from the stalk, and so it directly names the plant. In China, bamboo varieties are countless and have fostered a distinctive culture, recorded in works such as the Zhupu (Bamboo Register). The Shuowen even devotes a full section to bamboo, listing 144 characters beneath it. Wang Huizhi of the Jin period, a noted admirer of bamboo, once pointed to it and called it “this gentleman,” and from this expression, ci jun became a refined epithet for bamboo. In Japan, some bamboo came from China; the native word take aligns with the on reading chiku and seems to share roots with taka, “high.”"
