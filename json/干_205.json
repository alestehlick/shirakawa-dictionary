  "explanation": "In its earliest forms, this character is a straightforward pictograph of a rectangular shield. Related graphs help clarify the scene: 盾 depicts a person raising a shield before the eyes to protect the body, while 單 (used within 戰/戦 and 獸/獣) shows a round shield adorned with feathers, evoking warfare and hunting. 干 is the plain, rectangular shield itself. Shirakawa further notes that 周 adds beneath this shield the sign of a covenant vessel into which petitions to the gods were placed, expressing prayers for victory. From this origin, 干 first meant “shield,” and by extension “to fend off” or “to protect,” a sense visible in derivatives such as 扞, where the hand radical joins the shield to mean “to ward off.” The graph also came to be used for “to encroach, violate” and “to disturb,” and, through phonetic association with 乾 (kan), it was borrowed to write “to dry” (hosu, hiru)."
