  "explanation": "The original form is 獸, a compound in which 罾 is combined with 犬. Within 罾, the upper element 單 depicts an oval hunting shield adorned with twin feather pennants, while the lower “sai” represents a covenant vessel that held written petitions to the deities—together evoking the rite of praying for success before setting out to hunt. With the addition of the hunting dog 犬, the graph came to signify the act of the hunt itself. In oracle-bone inscriptions 獸 is used for “to hunt,” and only later did its sense shift to the quarry—the beast or game taken—whereupon the phono-semantic character 狩 was created to write the verb “to hunt.”"
