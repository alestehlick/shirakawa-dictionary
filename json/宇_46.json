  "explanation": "A phono‑semantic character: the roof sign 宀 marks the sphere of the house, while 于 supplies the sound u and a cluster of ideas. Shirakawa describes 于 as the figure of a knife with a large, slightly curved point, carrying senses of “great” and “curved.” The Shuowen glosses it as “the end of a house,” that is, the eaves. Brought under the roof radical, the graph first evoked the eaves and, by extension, the house itself. From this image of the protective overhang and the space it covers, the meaning broadened to the vast expanse overhead, yielding the later sense of “the universe.”"
