  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the bamboo radical depicts a pierced bamboo tube—originally a pipe with drilled holes used as a musical instrument—while 官 serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading kan. From this concrete image it came to denote any long, narrow tube or pipe, as in flutes, conduits, and anatomical passages, and it surfaces in words for wind music and clay or tracheal pipes. Expressions like kanken and kanki evoke peering through a slim tube and seeing only a narrow field. The sense of administering or controlling in compounds such as kansei and kanri reflects the influence of its phonetic element 官, which carries the idea of governing."
