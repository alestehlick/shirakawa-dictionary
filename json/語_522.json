  "explanation": "語 is a phono-semantic character: 吾 supplies the on-reading go, while 言 provides the semantic field of speech. Shirakawa sees 吾 as the image of a sai, a covenant vessel that held written prayers to the gods, sealed with a wooden lid—hence a sense of prayer preserved and entrusted to the divine. 言, for its part, shows the 辛 needle used in punitive tattooing and signifies the solemn words of oath-taking before the gods at trials or treaties, where one accepts that needle’s punishment if the vow is broken. Against this backdrop, 語 originally evoked words addressed upward—prayerful, protective speech—standing in contrast to 言 as more forceful, assertive utterance. From this core it broadened to mean words and language in general, and by extension “to tell, to relate,” as seen in compounds such as 言語."
