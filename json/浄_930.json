  "explanation": "Originally written 淨, this is a phono‑semantic character with the water element giving the sense of washing and purification, and 争 serving as the phonetic. Early usage seems to have carried a nuance of “cold, chill”—as the Shuowen glosses a related graph as “sei, chill”—a natural association, since crystalline, pure water is felt as cold. The phonetic 争 also appears in 静(靜), whose bronze form shows hands grasping a plow‑like implement, depicting a rite to purify agricultural tools; by extension, 浄 may likewise have referred to a ritual of purifying an implement. From these ritual and sensory associations, the character came to mean “pure, clean” and “to cleanse,” and it is prominently used in Buddhist vocabulary, as in 浄行 (pure practice) and 浄土 (the Pure Land)."
