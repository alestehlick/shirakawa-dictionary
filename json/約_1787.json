  "explanation": "約 is a picto-phonetic character. Its phonetic is 勺, the shape of a slightly bent ladle handle, which signals the on reading yaku. The graph itself evokes bending and tying a cord, so it came to mean to tie or bind, a knot, and by extension an oath. The content of a promise was once indicated by the number and form of knots, making 約 the word for an agreed pledge, as in 約束. From this it also developed the sense of what is broadly set or taken in outline, hence “general, approximate,” as in 大約. In antiquity, 約剤 referred to important treaty documents, 剂 indicating an inscription cut with a knife on a square tripod."
