  "explanation": "夜 is a compound graph combining 大 and 夕. In early forms, 大 draws a person seen from the front with arms and legs outstretched, while 夕 sketches the evening moon. Together they picture the moon appearing beneath the person’s arm, evoking the moment when the moon comes into view. From this image the character came to signify the time of evening and night."
