  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character formed with the heart element indicating feelings and the graph 生, which depicts a sprouting plant, serving as the phonetic for sei and suggesting what is inborn. Accordingly, 性 denotes the innate sensibility or feelings with which people are originally endowed—their nature, character, or what is \"by nature.\" In the Warring States period, debates on 性 (seisetsu) produced Mencius’s doctrine of innate goodness (seizensetsu) and, later, Xunzi’s doctrine of innate badness (seiakusetsu), the latter stressing the importance of self-cultivation rather than denying the possibility of moral improvement."
