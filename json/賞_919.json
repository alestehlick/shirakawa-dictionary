  "explanation": "Shirakawa interprets 賞 as a phono-semantic character: 尚 (also seen in early connections with 商) supplies the on reading shou, while 貝, the shell used as currency, marks the idea of valuables given as a reward. In bronze inscriptions the act of bestowing a prize appears as 商貝, literally “to grant shells.” From a graph showing this bestowal, forms with 貝 added under 商 produced 賈 and then developed into the present 賞. Its primary sense is to bestow a reward, hence ‘prize’ and ‘grant,’ and by extension it came to include ‘compensation’ and the praising sense seen in words like 褒賞."
