  "explanation": "This compound brings together 癶, the figure of both feet poised to set off, and 豆, a tall-footed vessel that can also be seen as a stepping stand. Placing ready feet upon that stand gives the sense of climbing and rising. In oracle-bone and bronze script there is also a special form where 廾, two hands, lift the high-footed 豆, expressing the act of raising a vessel to make an offering and, by extension, presenting or recommending something. The character is further used for abundant fruition, as in expressions describing crops that bear well, hence the nuance of ripening."
