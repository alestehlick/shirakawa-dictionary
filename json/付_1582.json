  "explanation": "Formed by combining the graphs for person (人) and hand (寸), 付 pictures a hand reaching toward a person to place something in their care. From that concrete act of handing over arose meanings such as deliver, give, attach, and append, which live on in words like fuzoku “attached” and futaku “entrust.” A cognate graph, 拊 (fu), shows the hand striking: clapping the hands expresses joy, while striking the breast marks sorrow—images that further highlight the hand-centered action at the heart of 付."
