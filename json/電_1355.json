  "explanation": "A compound graph that sets 雨, the rain sign used for atmospheric phenomena, over 申. In its early form, 申 depicts a sudden streak of electric light—a flash of lightning. Adding 雨 marks that light explicitly as a phenomenon of the storm-filled sky, yielding the sense of lightning. From this vivid image of a swift, forceful burst, the character naturally broadened to denote electricity in general, and it now appears widely in terms for electric current, telegraphy, and power generation."
