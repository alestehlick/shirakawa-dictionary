  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the heart radical (忄) signals an emotion, while 曾 serves as the phonetic element, giving the on reading so/zo and guiding the word’s sound. Shuowen glosses it directly as “to hate,” from which the sense of hatred as a feeling naturally develops. A line in the Book of Rites encapsulates its moral nuance: “When loving one comes to know what is bad; when hating one comes to know what is good,” suggesting that the emotion named by this character can, paradoxically, bring hidden qualities into clearer view."
