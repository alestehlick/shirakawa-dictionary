  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character whose older form is 擊, with a phonetic element indicating the on-reading geki. At its core is the form 轂, which Shirakawa explains as depicting a sack (橐) tied at the mouth and struck with a pike-like cudgel (殳). After the husks are loosened, grain is stuffed into the hanging bag and threshed by beating it; from this scene the graph 穀 arose with the sense of striking the contents of a sack. When the hand radical 手 was added below, the action of striking became overt, yielding 擊/撃. The meaning then broadened from beating a suspended bag to striking in general, and by extension to slaying, attacking, and fighting. The idea of a sack hung up and left to dangle is further suggested by the element written 繫."
