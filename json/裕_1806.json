  "explanation": "裕 is a phono-semantic character. Its phonetic is the element 谷, not the “valley” reading but the sign seen in 容 and 欲, where it depicts the dim appearance of divine pneuma rising above a sai— the covenant vessel that holds prayers. In bronze inscriptions for 裕, this 谷 sign is written within 衣, “garment,” so the whole graph shows numinous abundance manifesting upon clothing. From that image come the senses of plenitude and of garments that hang loose, reflected in modern compounds such as yufuku and fuyu denoting material wealth."
