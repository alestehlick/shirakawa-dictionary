  "explanation": "Originally written 燈, this is a phono-semantic character formed with the fire element for meaning and 登 for sound; the later vulgar form 灯, now the general-use character, similarly carries the fire element with 丁 as its phonetic guide. Traditional dictionaries gloss it as a fire light, akin to a candle or lamp, and in Japanese it names both the light itself (tomoshibi) and the flame (hi). By extension it can also refer to lighting implements—candelabra with multiple cup-like pans—evoked by masterpieces such as the celebrated fifteen-bowl bronze lamp excavated from the Warring States–period Zhongshan royal tombs."
