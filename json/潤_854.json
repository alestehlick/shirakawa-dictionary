  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the water element points to liquids and dampness, while 閏 functions as the phonetic. 閏 itself is linked to 壬, whose ancient sense evokes pregnancy and swelling—an image of fullness. From this, the character depicts water soaking in, seeping and spreading, hence to moisten and grow wet. The idea broadens to benefiting and enriching, and to the glossy sheen that moisture imparts. The compound 浸潤 expresses permeation by water, and terms like 潤沢 “abundant” echo the Great Learning’s line “Wealth adorns the house; virtue adorns the person,” capturing the sense of making things plentiful and well-endowed."
