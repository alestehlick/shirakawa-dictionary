  "explanation": "The original form is 靜, combining 青 and 爭. 青 is the blue‑green mineral pigment once used to consecrate ritual vessels, while 爭 depicts hands grasping a plow‑like implement. 靜 thus named the rite of purifying and exorcising the plow with blue pigment. By cleansing the tools of cultivation, people believed they could ward off insect harm to the grain and secure an abundant harvest. From this sense of purified implements and prayers for smooth tilling and reaping, the character broadened to mean peaceful and quiet. It can also stand in the place of 靖 (sei), associated with cleansing the ritual space and setting the mind at ease."
