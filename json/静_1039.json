  "explanation": "Originally written 靜, this character unites 青, the sacred blue‑green pigment used to consecrate ritual vessels, with 爭, a figure of hands gripping a plough‑like implement. It depicts the rite of purifying and exorcising the plough with that blue pigment to ward off pests and other harm from the grain, securing a rich harvest. From the cleansing of tools and the prayer for ease in tilling and reaping, the sense broadened to a state of ease and stillness—quiet, calm, and at peace."
