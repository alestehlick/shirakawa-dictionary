  "explanation": "This graph combines the form for sui—originally depicting blossoms or leaves drooping—and the earth element beneath, suggesting something hanging low enough to nearly touch the ground. From this image it takes the senses tareru and tarasu, to hang down or let fall, and by extension the idea of being on the verge of a state, as in expressions like suishi (near death) and suiro (approaching old age)."
