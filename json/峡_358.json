  "explanation": "Originally written as 峽, this is a picto‑phonetic character built from 山, “mountain,” and 夾, which serves as the phonetic and also evokes the act of holding something tightly between both arms. In ancient form 夾 depicts a person carrying another under the arms and conveys the sense of being pressed or clamped between. Set beside 山, it describes a place where mountains on both sides squeeze the land into a narrow passage—a gorge or narrows. When water runs through such a constricted place it becomes a valley stream, giving rise to terms like 峡谷, a gorge with steep cliff-like banks on either side."
