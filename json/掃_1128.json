  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character written with the hand element on the left and 帚 on the right. 帚, which carries the on reading sou, depicts a broom—twigs or leaves bound to the end of a stick—used to sprinkle fragrant liquid in ancestral mausoleums for purification and exorcism. Thus 掃 originally means to hold a broom in the hand and perform ritual cleansing within the mausoleum, and by extension it comes to mean sweeping away defilement. The Shuowen records the older form 埽, but the common form is 掃. In ritual language it pairs with 除—originally the act of planting a large needle (余) in the ground before the divine ladder (梯) used by the gods to ward off malign spirits—to form 掃除, a term for purification, which later yielded the everyday sense of sweeping and cleaning."
