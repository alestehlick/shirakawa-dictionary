  "explanation": "趣 is a phono‑semantic character: 走, showing running or going, provides the sense of movement, while 取 serves as the phonetic, giving the On reading shu. In bronze inscriptions the graph appears in the title of the horse office known from the Zhou Rites, pointing to duties connected with going, driving, and advancing. From this concrete sense of setting out or heading toward something, the character developed abstract meanings such as purport, tenor, and the distinctive charm or flavor of a thing. Bronze texts also attest loan uses, including for fine bronze, and by association with 取 it can carry the literal sense of “to take.”"
