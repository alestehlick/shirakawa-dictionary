  "explanation": "Shirakawa understands 遊 as a picto-phonetic character built on 旃, which combines a flagstaff with a fixed streamer and the figure of a person, depicting someone holding up the clan banner. Because the divine spirit was believed to dwell in that flag, 旃 originally meant to raise the banner and set out. From this base came 遊 and its variant 游: the Shuowen explains 游 in terms of the hanging streamers of a flag (旒), while 遊 was formed by adding the walking element 辵 to 旃 to express movement; a related form, 游, later specialized in the sense “to swim.” In origin, then, 遊/游 evoked the untrammeled going of the indwelling spirit—the leisurely progress of the gods—and only later broadened to the human sense of play and carefree wandering."
