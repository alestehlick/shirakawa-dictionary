  "explanation": "Originally written 佛, this is a phono-semantic character with 弗 (read futsu) providing the sound. In the Shuowen it is explained as “to see indistinctly,” hence senses like faint, dim, and vague—nuances that survive in words such as 彷彿 and 髣髴, which describe something that seems to appear only hazily. Later the graph was adopted to write 仏 in 仏陀, a phonetic rendering of the Sanskrit buddha, and so it came to mean “Buddha” and to appear in compounds like 仏教. The Sanskrit buddha denotes one who has attained true enlightenment."
