  "explanation": "准 is a phono-semantic character originally written as 準, with 隼 serving as the phonetic element that points to the on reading jun. In early administrative usage it denoted the imperial act of granting permission—the裁可 bestowed by the Son of Heaven. The process of submitting a memorial and receiving approval was first called 制可, and later the granting itself came to be expressed with set phrases such as 准允 and 准奏, both built on 准 in the sense of “to allow.” This core meaning continues in modern compounds like 批准, the formal ratification a state gives when concluding a treaty."
