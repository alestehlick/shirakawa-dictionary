  "explanation": "Originally written 從, the graph centers on 从, a figure of people aligned and turning to the left. In the later form 従, 从 functions as the phonetic element that gives the on reading ju, while 彳, the “step” radical, adds the sense of walking along a small path. Together they depict someone proceeding behind another on the road, hence the meaning “to follow,” which later broadened to following or complying in general."
