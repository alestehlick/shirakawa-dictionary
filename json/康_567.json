  "explanation": "康 is a compound graph that sets 庚 over 米. The element 庚 depicts a person gripping a pestle with both hands to husk and polish grain; placing 米, “rice,” beneath makes the act of processing grain explicit. Early forms even show the scattered hulls, revealing that the character originally pointed to 糠 (nuka), rice bran—the by‑product of polishing. Classical glossaries already gloss 康 as “calm,” and bronze inscriptions record the phrase 民康靜, meaning that the people are at peace. Thus in antiquity 康 expressed a state of settled well‑being and peace."
