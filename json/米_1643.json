  "explanation": "A pictograph of a rice spike heavy with kernels. The Shuowen defines it as “the grain of su (cereals),” noting that the graph takes the shape of the rice plant; in use it came to mean kome, rice. Wet-paddy cultivation was already established in the middle and lower Yangtze, and the rice associated with the Neolithic Qujialing culture near Wuhan is said to be close to the variety known in Japan."
