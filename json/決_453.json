  "explanation": "決 is a phono-semantic character: the water radical 氵 joins the phonetic 夬. In early forms, 夬 shows a hand (又) grasping a notched jade ring, 玦 (jue), a pendant worn at the waist that served as a small cutter; that cutting force in 夬 appears as well in graphs like 抉, “to gouge.” With water added, 決 depicts cutting through so that stagnant water can run off—opening a breach in a dike to release a flood. Because cutting a levee is a momentous act undertaken with firm resolve (one even raised the jade jue as a sign of determination), the character naturally extends from “to cut and let flow” to “to decide,” a clear, resolute settling of the heart."
