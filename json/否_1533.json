  "explanation": "A compound graph built from 不 and the mouth-like component that, in ritual context, is not a mouth but a sai—an oath receptacle into which petitions to the gods were placed. In this view, 否 depicts the gods withholding consent to a renewed recitation of the prayer, giving rise to senses like “nay,” “to refuse,” and “not so.” The Shuowen glosses it as “not so.” Separately, in bronze inscriptions the same graph was also used in the lineage of 丕, where 不 originally pictured a swelling calyx and pistil, and 否, with an added fruit or seed element, expressed “great.” These were originally distinct lines, but they later converged under the single character 否, which now bears both the negative sense and, in archaic usage, the sense “great.”"
