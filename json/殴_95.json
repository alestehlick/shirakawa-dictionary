  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains the original form as 毆, a compound of 區 and 殳. The graph 區 evokes a hidden sacred enclosure where numerous covenant vessels (sai) holding written petitions are set before the gods, while 殳 is the long cane-like pike used in ritual. To “殴” is to strike with that pike in front of the divine—an emphatic gesture meant to press the spirits to heed and fulfill the prayer—whence the senses “to beat” and “to strike.” Related graphs such as 歐/欧 and 謳 share the phonetic and suggest the chant-like voice of prayer that accompanies the rite."
