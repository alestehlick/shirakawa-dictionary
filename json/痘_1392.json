  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 痘 takes 豆 as its phonetic, giving the on-yomi to, and names a disease whose blisters were likened to peas. Hence terms such as 痘瘡 (“smallpox sores”) and 疱瘡 (“blister sores”). The illness is marked by high fever, the eruption of watery blisters, and the pockmarks they leave. It is a highly contagious viral disease that was long feared for its high mortality, officially classified among legally designated infectious diseases, yet controlled through 種痘 (preventive inoculation) and now regarded as nearly eradicated."
