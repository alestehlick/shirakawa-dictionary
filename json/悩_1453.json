  "explanation": "悩 is a phono-semantic character. In its original form 惱, the heart radical (心, here as 忄) signals the realm of feelings, while the right-hand element serves as the phonetic and corresponds to the ancient graph 囟, the infant’s fontanel—regarded as the seat of thought. This is the same image seen in 思, whose earliest form places 囟 above 心 and means “to think.” With the heart added, the picture becomes thought in turmoil—brooding and pained reflection—hence the senses “to be troubled” and “to suffer.” The Shuowen gloss “to hold a grudge” further evokes harbored vexation; in usage it expresses nayamu, to be afflicted with worries."
