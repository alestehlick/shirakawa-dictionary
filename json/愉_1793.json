  "explanation": "愉 is a phono-semantic character. Its right component 兪 (yu) supplies the sound and originally combines 舟 (a tub or plate) with 余 (a handled surgical knife), depicting the lancing of an abscess and the draining of pus and blood into a vessel—hence the idea of healing and recovery. With the heart element on the left, this notion of cure shifts into the realm of feeling: when sickness is healed, the heart is put at ease. From that state of ease arise senses such as to enjoy, to be glad, and to feel at peace. A kindred graph built on the same structure, 愈, besides meaning to heal, also came to mean to surpass and ever more."
