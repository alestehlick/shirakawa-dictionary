  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the semantic element is 羊, evoking sheep, animals known for moving and acting as a flock; the phonetic is 君, which supplies the on reading gun and carries an associative sense of gathering, as seen in related writings like 摽/捃 meaning “to collect, to gather.” From the image of a flock of sheep, the meaning broadened to any assembled group—of people, as in gunshu (multitude), and then more generally to things—hence its use for the intransitive senses “to flock, to crowd together” (mureru, muragaru) and the noun “a group” (mure)."
