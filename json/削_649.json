  "explanation": "This character combines 肖 and the knife 刀. In Shirakawa’s view, 肖 sketches a small piece of meat pierced by bone or marked with sinew. With the addition of the knife, the graph vividly captures the act of trimming flesh away, which gives rise to meanings such as shaving, paring, cutting out, and deleting. In later usage it was also borrowed for 鞘, so it can at times denote the sheath of a knife."
