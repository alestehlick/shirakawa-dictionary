  "explanation": "祭 is a compound graph that brings together the form of meat (月), a hand (又), and the altar of worship (示). In early script it shows a hand presenting meat upon the altar, the concrete act of making a sacrificial offering, and from this it comes to mean the rite or festival (matsuri). In the pairing 祭祀 (saishi), 祭 denotes rites for the ancestral spirits at the mausoleum, whereas 祀, built on 巳, the serpent emblem of a natural numen, points to the deification of natural deities; in actual usage the two often stand close in sense."
