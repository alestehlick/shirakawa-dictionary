  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 旋 as a compound: one element depicts a command flag on a pole with a tubular streamer, while 疋 shows the lower leg from the knee downward. Together they picture turning the feet at the signal of the flag—wheeling or reversing under orders. From this scene the character first meant to turn back or change direction, and later broadened to the sense of circling and revolving. The Shuowen glosses it as “to circulate,” reflecting how troops moved here and there in response to the commander’s flag; in later usage, 周旋 came to mean attending to or helping with matters, but the core image behind 旋 is the ordered turn that becomes rotation."
