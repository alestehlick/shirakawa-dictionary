  "explanation": "In bronze inscriptions, 農 combines 田, the field, with 辰, originally the figure of a shellfish extending its foot. The character depicts working the earth with a shell-bladed implement—a mussel shell fixed to the end of a stick, a “venus shell” tool used to cut and till. In oracle-bone forms it appears with 林 or 森 alongside 辰, evoking the clearing of groves and fields with that tool as cultivation began. Over time the field element 田 came to be written as 曲 within the received form of 農. A bronze inscription on the Ling Tripod records 藉農, denoting communal cultivation of sacred fields to produce offerings for the gods, showing the word’s ritual associations. Thus 農 came to mean tilling and, by extension, agriculture. Relatedly, 辱 portrays a hand wielding the same 辰-tool and signifies cutting weeds—a reminder that farming begins with clearing grass."
