  "explanation": "In the ancient script, 美 is a pictograph of a sheep shown in its complete, harmonious form. The upper part renders the animal from the front—its head and horns—while the lower element, written as 大, evokes the hindquarters: the stance associated with a ewe’s hips and the way a newborn lamb drops down at birth. Together they depict the sheep from horns to hind legs, and thus name the beauty of a fully grown, well-formed animal. In ritual practice, a sacrificial sheep had to be flawless; the same ideal appears in 義, which combines 羊 with 我 (a saw) to signify something perfectly sound and correct. From this image of a beautiful, perfect sheep, 美 came to mean “beautiful” in general, and by extension “good” and praiseworthy."
