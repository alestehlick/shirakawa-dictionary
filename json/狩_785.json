  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 狩 as a later phono-semantic creation: the left side 犭 evokes the hunting dog, while the right side 守 supplies the sound shu. Earlier, the act of hunting was written with 獸 (獣). Its ancient form combined an upper 単, depicting an oval shield adorned with twin feather plumes used in the hunt, and a lower ritual receptacle for covenant-prayers to the gods, evoking the formal petition for success before setting out; with the addition of the dog element, this yielded 獸, originally “the hunt” itself. As usage shifted and 獣 came to mean the quarry—the animal taken—狩 was coined specifically for the act “to hunt.” In compounds such as 巡狩, it preserves an elevated nuance of the sovereign’s circuit to inspect and safeguard the realm, echoing the sense of 巡守, “to go around and protect.”"
