  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 植 as a phono-semantic compound. The tree element points to the act of planting, while 直 supplies both the sound and a key nuance. He analyzes 直 as a graph formed from 省—an eye with an added ornament, symbolizing official inspection of the provinces to rectify wrongs—together with a component meaning “hidden,” conveying clandestine investigation and the straightening out of injustice. From this comes the sense “straight, correct.” In 植, that uprightness is applied to the image of setting a sapling straight in the ground, yielding the meanings “to plant” and “to set up.” The phonetic 直 also underlies the on reading shoku, as seen in related graphs like 殖 and 埴, and the character later extends in compounds such as 植物 for plants."
