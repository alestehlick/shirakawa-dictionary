  "explanation": "Originally written 揭, this is a phono-semantic character: the hand on the left marks the action, while 曷 on the right gives the sound and evokes a ritual scene. In ancient curse rites, 曷 depicts adding a vessel containing covenant writings for the gods to the bones of the dead and loudly invoking the deceased as a curse-spirit. From this ritual background come graphs like 喝 (the fierce cry), 渇 (parched from loud praying), 謁 (to petition the gods), and 遏 (to cut off a malign influence). For those who died unburied in the street (道殣), people set up a tall grave board or stone (ketsu) to appease the spirit, and on it posted a notice (掲示) naming the dead. Thus 揭/掲 came to mean to hoist or put up a board or notice—hence “to raise, display, or post.”"
