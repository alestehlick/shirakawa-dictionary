  "explanation": "潟 is a phono-semantic character: the water radical evokes a watery shore, while the phonetic element 昔 signals the On reading seki, in line with 斥 (seki, “to drive back, repulse”). It names the stretch of shoreline revealed as the sea is driven back at ebb tide—the tidal flats that can form lagoons—and in Japan it commonly appears in place names for such coastal features. The compound 潟鹵 (also written 斥鹵), read sekiro, refers to saline ground full of sand or stones, unsuitable for cultivation."
