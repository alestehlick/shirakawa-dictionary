  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats 飼 as a phono-semantic character: the food element conveys the idea of eating, while 司 functions as the phonetic, pointing to the On reading shi. In bronze inscriptions a related form appears as 飮 and is used with the sense of 食 in the binome 飲食, “drinking and eating,” with 食 likely acting as the pictophonetic component within 飮. The specific meaning “to keep or feed animals” is not found in early materials; attestations of 飼 in this sense begin in the Tang–Song period."
