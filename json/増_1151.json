  "explanation": "Originally written 增, this is a phono-semantic character. The semantic element is the earth radical, evoking the act of heaping or piling up. The phonetic is 曾 (here noted alongside 會), whose ancient form depicts stacked steaming baskets set over a pot of boiling water, a vivid image of layering and accumulation as steam rises. Joined to “earth,” the sense naturally becomes that of piling up in quantity—hence ‘to increase,’ ‘to add,’ and ‘to raise.’"
