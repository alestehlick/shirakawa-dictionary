  "explanation": "調 is a phono-semantic character: 言, “speech/utterance,” supplies the semantic field, while 周 serves as the phonetic. In ancient forms 周 depicts a rectangular shield whose entire surface is carved with a beautifully ordered pattern. That image of elegant, all-over arrangement underlies the character’s core sense of bringing things into balance. Thus the Shuowen glosses 調 as “to harmonize,” seen in 調和, and by extension it came to mean the orderly setting of musical tones—tuning. From this base it naturally developed the senses “to adjust,” “to settle,” and “to put in order,” and in Japanese usage it also came to mean “to examine, investigate.” 周 also functions as the on-reading indicator for chō in related characters, reinforcing the reading of 調."
