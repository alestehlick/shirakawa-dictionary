  "explanation": "忍 is a phono-semantic character with 心, the heart, beneath 刃, the blade. Here 刃 serves chiefly as the phonetic, pointing to the on-readings jin/nin and linking the graph to the 靭 series—seen in 靭/靱帯 (ligament)—where the core idea is toughness with pliancy. From the image of a strong, flexible band binding bone to bone (the quality called kyōjin, “flexible and strong”), that sense is internalized: applied to the heart and mind it becomes quiet strength, patient endurance, and self-restraint—bearing up, putting up with, even ‘lowering oneself’ when needed. Already in the Shuowen it is explained in terms of nintai, patient bearing."
