  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 湯 as a phono-semantic compound: the water element provides the field of meaning, while 易 serves as the phonetic. In his view, 易 depicts a piece of jade set upon a stand, its brilliance streaming downward—an image likened to the sun’s radiance. By extension, water warmed under such sunlike brilliance becomes “yu,” hot water, which is the core sense of 湯. The same phonetic 易 marks the On-reading series seen in characters like 瑒 (a kind of jade) and 暢 (to grow long, unimpeded), reinforcing the sound value that yields tō. Culturally, the character evokes the ancient Japanese ordeal known as kukatachi (盟神探湯), in which an accused person swore before the gods and immersed a hand in hot water—the innocent unharmed, the guilty scalded—while in China a tripod cooking vessel served in analogous rites. The character also lives on in Japanese linguistic lore: “yutoyomi” (湯桶読み), literally “hot-water bucket reading,” names mixed readings where the first character takes kun and the second On, paired with its counterpart “jubakoyomi” (重箱読み) for the reverse pattern."
