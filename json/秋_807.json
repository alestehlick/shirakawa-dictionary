  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 秋 as a ritual image born from the farming year. The oldest form combined 禾, the grain plant, with a pictograph of an insect such as a locust (later written with the shape 龜), and 火, fire. In autumn, swarms of grasshoppers would ravage the ripening crop, and people performed burning rites both to destroy the pests and to pray for abundance. Oracle-bone forms even show an insect being burned, and from this rite the older graph carried the sense of ripening and harvest. Over time the insect element was reduced, leaving fire beside grain to yield the present 秋. Because this rite was tied to the season of insect damage, the character came to designate the season “autumn,” even though the oracle inscriptions themselves do not yet record the four seasonal names."
