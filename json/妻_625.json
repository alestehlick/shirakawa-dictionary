  "explanation": "This character is a pictograph of a woman arranging an elaborate bridal coiffure: both hands are raised to the head, setting three ornamental hairpins into place. It captures the moment of being dressed for a wedding, which naturally yields the sense “wife,” and by extension was also used as a verb meaning to match or marry. Its counterpart 夫 depicts a man seen from the front (the 大 form) with a long hairpin thrust vertically through his topknot, likewise showing ceremonial finery. Together, 夫 and 妻 present the groom and bride adorned for marriage."
