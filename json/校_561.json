  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 校 sets 交 as its phonetic, a figure viewed from the front with legs crossed, and pairs it with wood to suggest crossed timbers at a roof. The image points to a purpose-built hall: in antiquity, a school where children of the nobility studied upon coming of age. The older form of “learning,” 學, originally showed that same timbered school building; by adding a child within and a hand element, it came to express guiding and teaching. Thus 校 names the school as the physical place, 学 the act of learning, and 教 the act of teaching conducted there. From the notion of checking and organizing within the school context, 校 also extended to the senses of comparing, consulting or planning, and counting."
