  "explanation": "Originally written as 著, this is a phono-semantic character with 者 providing the sound. Shirakawa explains 者 as depicting an earthen hedge raised to protect a village, into which written charms (日) were buried; by implanting these writings, incantatory power was made to adhere to the barrier. From this ritual sense of making something stick came the meanings “to attach, to adhere,” and by extension “to arrive” and “to put on.” 着 is the popular form of 著 and came to be used for everyday senses such as wearing garments and arriving (chaku), while 著 (cho) developed literary senses like “clear, manifest” and “to write and publish.”"
