  "explanation": "郭 is a phono-semantic character that grew out of a plan view of a fortress: walls enclosing a space, with watchtowers thrust out to look far into the distance. That pictorial form was later streamlined into 享, which became the phonetic element, and joined with 邑, the city/place sign, to yield the present character. The image is of a settlement ringed on all four sides by ramparts with projecting towers at the cardinal points, so the word comes to mean the encircling walls of a city and, by extension, any enclosure whose interior is left open."
