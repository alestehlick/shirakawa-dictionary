  "explanation": "A phono-semantic compound: the component 敕 (also written 勅) depicts beating a bundle of brushwood into orderly alignment, expressing the act of straightening and arranging. The element 正 supplies the sound sei and also contributes its sense of “to make correct,” functioning as a co-phonetic that bears meaning as well as sound. From this, 整 originally meant to set what is uneven or irregular in order, and by extension came to mean to arrange, to correct, and to bring things into a proper state."
