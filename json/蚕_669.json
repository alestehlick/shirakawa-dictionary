  "explanation": "Originally written 蠶, this is a phono-semantic graph: the insect element marks its class, while the phonetic part gives the reading san. The Shuowen defines it as “an insect that spits out threads,” that is, the silkworm. In oracle-bone inscriptions the word appears as a vivid pictograph of the creature itself; some forms even show a worm-like body set upon a mulberry leaf with the insect sign added. Other early graphs record rites to a silkworm deity, written with the silkworm element and the altar sign, revealing cultic veneration. By Shang times, sericulture—raising silkworms and reeling cocoons—was already practiced and ranked with agriculture as a vital industry. In the Zhou period the empress personally performed the sericulture rite, and weaving garments for the gods and for festivals was prescribed. From these deep ritual and economic roots, silk became a prized export of China and ultimately lent its name to the trans-Asian trade route known as the Silk Road."
