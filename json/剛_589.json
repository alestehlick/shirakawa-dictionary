  "explanation": "剛 is a compound that joins 岡 and 刀 (the rittō “knife”). In Shirakawa’s view, 岡 depicts the clay mold used in metal casting, fired from below (stylized in the graph as the mountain form) until it hardens into a firm shell. Adding 刀 evokes the act of cutting or prying that hardened mold away after casting—a difficult task because the mold is so solid. From this scene the character came to mean what is hard, tight, and unyielding, and by extension the strength and vigor of character celebrated in compounds such as 剛毅, 剛直, 剛健, and 剛勇."
