  "explanation": "丹 is a pictograph of cinnabar being drawn up from a vertical shaft like a well. Cinnabar-bearing red clay was thought to rise through openings in the earth, forming straight, vertical veins that were mined by digging such shafts; the character portrays that substance gathered within a well. From this it came to mean cinnabar and, by extension, red. In China, techniques for extracting mercury and red pigment from cinnabar flourished and gave rise to alchemical practices (ren-dan arts), and many medicinal names include 丹, reflecting the belief that cinnabar could lengthen life. The graph appears in 丹青 for the red and blue pigments of painting, and it also came to suggest wholehearted sincerity and painstaking care, as felt in words like 丹誠, 丹精, 丹心, and 丹念."
