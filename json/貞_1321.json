  "explanation": "This character combines the divination sign 卜 with 貝, which in early oracle-bone and bronze forms depicts not a shell but a sacrificial tripod (ding). 卜 shows the crack made by heating a tortoise plastron, the medium for consulting the divine will. 貞 thus portrays divination performed with the tripod, a ritual of asking and determining the gods’ intent by observing the state of the sacrificial offering. The result of such divination (貞卜) was regarded as correct, good, and true, which gave the character its senses of uprightness, chastity, and integrity. The Zuozhuan (Ai, 17th year) records “衛侯貞卜,” attesting to this practice."
