  "explanation": "A compound graph of three 口 set in a row, where 口 is not a mouth but, in Shirakawa’s reading, the sai: a sacred receptacle for slips bearing written prayers and covenants to the gods. Arraying many such vessels suggests collective recitation and the accumulation of petitions; from this image the character came to signify multiplicity and assortment—kinds, varieties, numbers—and by extension goods and articles. Related graphs elaborate the same ritual scene: 區 (区) shows many such vessels prayed over in a secluded place; 歐 (欧) emphasizes praying in a loud voice; 謳 gives that prayerful voice as song; and 毆 (殴) depicts urging a prayer’s fulfillment by striking the vessels with a pike (殳)."
