  "explanation": "This character is a compound of the element written as 启 and the movement sign 辵. The former depicts sacrificial meat (shinniku) borne and offered in rites of prayer for victory at the army shrine or ancestral mausoleum as troops prepared to depart; expeditions proceeded with this consecrated offering held aloft. With 辵, “to walk, go,” the graph pictures advancing while bearing the sacrifice, and thus came to signify driving on in pursuit of a fleeing enemy. In later usage it broadened to the general senses of following up, catching up, and reaching."
