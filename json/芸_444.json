  "explanation": "In its oldest forms the character shows a young sapling held with both hands and set into the soil: one form depicts the sapling being offered in both hands, another shows it being planted in the earth. This core element, later written as the component 埶/執, thus expresses the act of planting. Because the meaning pertains to vegetation, the grass radical was attached to form 蓺, and with the later addition of 云 the graph became 藝. Modern Japanese simplifies the planting component, yielding 芸, a shape that can resemble another graph meaning to weed. From the image of carefully planting and cultivating, the sense broadened to cultivated skill—hence art, craft, and accomplishment, as seen in compounds like 技芸."
