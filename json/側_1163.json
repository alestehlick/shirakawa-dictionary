  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the person element marks a human context, while the phonetic soku (則) goes back to bronze tripods (鼎) whose rounded sides bore incised treaty clauses. From this image of the vessel’s side face, the sense developed into the side of a person—the flank, the area next to someone—and more broadly one side of a thing, as in katagawa. The graph is also used in place of 仄 for the sense faint, dim, or humble."
