  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats 店 as a phono‑semantic character, with 占 acting as the phonetic that signals the On reading ten, as seen in related graphs like 佔 and 坫. The Jade Book (Gyoku Hen) explains 坫 as the stand where wine cups are set back; while that sense belongs chiefly to 坫, 店 likely began as a variant of it. From the image of goods laid out in the corner of a hall like cups arranged on a stand, the graph came to mean a place of display and sale—a shop. Its use later broadened to lodging, a traveler’s inn or hotel, as reflected in compounds such as 飯店, which can denote a hotel and, in Japanese usage, also the name for a Chinese restaurant."
