  "explanation": "In its earliest form, 受 brings together two hands—an upper hand written with爪 and a lower hand with 又—around 舟, which here represents a tray or bowl. The upper hand places something into the vessel, while the lower hand takes it out, so the graph captures both sides of the exchange. Accordingly, in oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions it could mean either to grant or to receive. Later, the act of granting was distinguished with the creation of 授, and 受 settled into its familiar sense of receiving."
