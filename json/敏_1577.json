  "explanation": "In early script, 敏 combines 每—the figure of a woman with her hair done up and adorned—and 又, a hand. It pictures hands adjusting hair ornaments: the bustle of careful preparation for sacred rites. From this scene arose 敏しむ, “to devote oneself to the rites,” and the sense in 敏捷 of not neglecting one’s duties but moving with nimble energy. Hence the character came to mean to apply oneself, and by extension quick, agile, and, from the poised readiness of ritual action, clever and wise. A related note: the graph that gave rise to 捷 originally showed a woman with bound hair busily serving in the ancestral mausoleum, explaining its sense of “rapid.” When the thread element was added to 敏 and the form expanded, it produced 繁."
