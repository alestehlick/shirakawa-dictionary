  "explanation": "This character began as a picture of an animal skin: the entire hide flayed open from head to limbs and fully worked. In contrast to 皮, which shows the raw hide being torn off with a hand (又), 革 depicts the finished product—hair and fat removed, the skin softened—hence its core meaning of leather and the compound 皮革 for hides and leather. Because tanning so thoroughly remakes the material, 革 naturally came to express renewal and reform, yielding uses such as 改革 (reform) and 革命 (a dynastic change or sweeping political and social transformation). A related graph, 韋, shows a hide hung up to dry; in combination as 韋革 it specifically refers to tanned leather."
