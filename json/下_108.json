  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 下 as an indicative graph. In early script a turned-over palm is drawn, and a marking point placed beneath it singles out what lies under the hand—hence the sense of down, lower, under. A point placed above the palm yields the counterpart 上. Over time the indicating dot lengthened into a short vertical stroke, giving rise to the standard paired forms of 上 and 下, with later variants adding side dots. From the concrete idea of the lower side it naturally extends to downward motion—to go or come down, to lower or bring down—and by metaphor to sequence in time (what comes later, at the end) and to rank, expressing the relation of superior and inferior, including the sense of being lower or inferior."
