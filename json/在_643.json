  "explanation": "Shirakawa takes 在 as a compound of 才 and 士. In early forms, 才 depicts a landmark post set up to mark and sanctify a spot: a vertical stake with a horizontal plate, to which a sacred receptacle for covenant texts is affixed, making the place a dwelling of the divine and thus a place that truly “is.” To this, 士—understood as the head of a small broadax—was added as a ritual implement that protects the signpost and affirms the reality of that sanctified presence. From this sense of “being” under the authority of a sacred site, 才 stands as the prototype of 在, which first meant “to be, to exist” in a sacral context, then generalized to “to be” for things, and for people took the form oru, “to be present.” Relatedly, 存, formed by adding 子 “child” to 才, expresses the child’s life and continued existence being secured through that same act of sanctification."
