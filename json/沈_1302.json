  "explanation": "沈 is a phono-semantic compound: the water element signals the domain of meaning, while the phonetic 冘 points to the on reading and appears in kindred characters such as 枕 and 鴆. In the oracle-bone form it is a pictograph showing an ox or sheep in water, reflecting the ancient rite of sinking a sacrificial animal in a river, especially in times of flood. From this concrete image of a river-sinking offering, the character broadened in sense to “sink” and “submerge,” and by extension to being buried, hidden or latent, growing quiet, and settling down or becoming absorbed. As a counterpart to the river offering signified by 沈, there was also the earth-burying rite written 霾; together they were spoken of as 沈霾, the paired practices of sinking in water and burying in soil."
