  "explanation": "Originally a pictograph, the character shows a hollow caught between two mountain slopes, suggesting the concave ground nestled in a range. Over time its sense shifted from that basin-like topography to the small swell of land we call a hill. Standing at the boundary between rise and hollow, it naturally appears in words that pair hills with ravines (丘壑), and in the common term for rolling hill country (丘陵). In antiquity, such contours were attractive places to live; later they became favored sites for burial, reflected in compounds like 丘墳 and 丘墓, while the abandoned remains of former settlements were called 丘墟. The character thus preserves a landscape image even as its everyday meaning settles on the modest rise of a hill."
