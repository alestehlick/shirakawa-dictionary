  "explanation": "Originally written 將, the character is a compound of 爿, a stand or table with legs, 肉, meat, and 寸, the hand. It pictures hands presenting meat above a stand—a ritual offering. When armies departed for the front, consecrated meat was offered with prayers for victory, and the person who bore that sacrificial meat at the head of the column led the troops; from this ritual role arose the sense of a “general,” and by extension “to lead” and “to conduct.” Shirakawa also notes that 爿 appears as a mark associated with imperial princes claiming descent from the Yin royal line, with characters like 將 and 壯 indicating rank within that house, from which generals were likely chosen. Thus 将 carries the ideas of offering and worship, leadership in action, and, in adverbial use, “just about to.”"
