  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: the right-hand element, 易, supplies the reading yo and depicts a sacred jewel—written with the graph 日—set upon a stand, its sparkles streaming downward. Contact with that radiance was believed to quicken human vitality and make the waves of spirit flourish. The left element, 阜, originally shows the divine ladder by which gods ascended and descended. Thus 陽 portrays a jewel placed before that ladder, a scene of divine authority. In later usage it came to denote the sun and its light and warmth, and by extension the sunny side of terrain—the south face of a mountain and the north bank of a river. It is also used as a loan for 佯, “to feign, to deceive,” as seen in compounds like 陽狂 (feigned madness) and 陽言 (lying words)."
