  "explanation": "俸 is a phono-semantic character: the person radical indicates a human relation, while 奉 supplies the sound and underlying sense. In ancient forms, 奉 shows a twig lifted high and presented with both hands—supported even from below—an image of reverent offering to the gods. Carried over into social life, 俸 came to mean something presented to a person, hence a stipend or salary, as seen in words like 俸禄 (stipend) and the allowance term 扶持."
