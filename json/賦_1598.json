  "explanation": "賦 is a phono-semantic character: 貝 (valuables) suggests goods and money, while 武 provides the sound. The Shuowen glosses it as “to gather,” and as 賦斂, the collection of levies. From the sense of collecting and gathering, the meaning extends to apportioning and bestowing—hence terms like 分賦 (dividing out portions), 賦予 (to grant), and 天賦 (heaven-bestowed endowment). The same graph names the ornate Han-period literary form fu, long rhapsodies that revel in describing the grandeur of nature and the capital—such as the Odes of the Two Capitals and the Odes of the Three Capitals. In Japan, a comparable current is the land-praising song that invokes the spirit of place, exemplified by the Yoshino Sanka in the Manyoshu."
