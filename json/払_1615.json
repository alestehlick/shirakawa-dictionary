  "explanation": "Originally written 拂, this is a phono-semantic character: the hand element (扌) is joined with 弗 as the phonetic. Shirakawa explains 弗 as the image of a rope wound lengthwise around several pieces of wood—wood that refuses to bundle, spreading and resisting constraint—hence nuances of scattering and opposing. With the hand added, the character comes to depict the act of sweeping aside what will not stay together: brushing off, beating away, removing. From this core image arise compounds such as 払暁, the “sweeping away” of night at dawn; 払拭, a thorough wiping clean; and 払底, the complete using-up of supplies. It can also substitute in compounds for 弼 “to aid,” as in 払輔. In Japanese, harau extends from the physical motion of brushing off to the social act of payment, as in paying money or attention."
