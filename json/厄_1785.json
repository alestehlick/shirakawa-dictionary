  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 厄 as a pictograph of a chariot’s yoke—the horizontal bar hung at a horse’s neck and coupled to the vehicle. From this core image, related graphs illuminate its sense: 扼 (“to hold down, suppress”) evokes the act of fitting or tightening the yoke, and 阨 depicts a perilous mountain defile where cliffs close in on both sides. Through these associations of constriction and danger, 厄 came to be used for “calamity” and “misfortune.”"
