  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the illness determinative marks the realm of disease, while 利 functions as the phonetic, supplying the on-reading ri. The sense inherent in 利—sharp and quick—suits the acute, cutting nature of the ailment. In compounds such as 下痢, it denotes stools that fail to solidify and pass like water (diarrhea). It also names epidemic intestinal illnesses, as in 疫痢, dysentery often seen in children, and 赤痢, bacillary dysentery, an acute epidemic of the digestive tract."
