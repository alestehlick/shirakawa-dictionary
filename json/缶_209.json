  "explanation": "缶 began as a pictograph of a clay vessel. The fuller form 罐 pairs this vessel element with the phonetic 雚 to give the Sino-Japanese reading kan (Chinese guan) and was used for jars, pots, and even a well bucket. In modern writing the general-use character 缶 stands in place of 罐, essentially the same vessel graph without its phonetic. In compounds such as 缶詰 “canned food,” where the container is metal, the metal-radical form 鑵 is sometimes employed; both 罐 and 鑵 function as phonetic stand-ins for the borrowed sound kan from English can."
