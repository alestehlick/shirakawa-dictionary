  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 終 as a phono‑semantic character formed by the thread classifier 糸, giving the sense of “thread,” and the phonetic 冬. In its ancient form, 冬 depicts the tied ends of knitted yarn and originally wrote the idea of an “ending.” When 冬 later came to designate only the season “winter,” the thread element was added to restore the earlier sense, yielding 終. From the image of tying off loose ends arise meanings such as ending, finishing, and bringing things to a conclusion—reflected in compounds like 終結 (conclusion) and 終始 (from beginning to end)—and by extension it can also mean “at last, finally.”"
