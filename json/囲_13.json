  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character whose original form is 圍: the outer 囗 is the city wall, and inside stands 韋. The graph 韋 was formed from the footprint sign 止 arranged to show movement going around—right, left, above, and below—evoking the act of circling; as a phonetic it gives the on reading i and carries the sense of passing or going around (as in 違). Set against the image of city walls, this circling can mean patrolling to protect (which yields 衛, “to guard”) or investing an enemy by surrounding it (圍). Thus 囲 came to mean to enclose, surround, and encircle."
