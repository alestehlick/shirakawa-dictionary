  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the hand radical hints at an act performed with the hands, while 昔 serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading so, as also seen in 錯 (“to polish”). The Shuowen glosses it as oku, “to put,” in the sense of setting something in place and thereby allowing it to be as it should. From this core idea of deliberate placement comes the nuance of arranging or disposing matters so that things settle into a state of ease. Hence compounds like sochi (“measures, steps”) for handling affairs into order, soji (“phraseology”) for the placing of words, sodai for a learned person capable of managing large matters, and kyoso (“bearing, behavior”) for the way one “places” oneself in conduct."
