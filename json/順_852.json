  "explanation": "In early forms, 順 often combines the water-crossing graph 涉(渉) with 頁, the image of a head bowed in reverence beneath a ceremonial cap. Bronze inscriptions record the compound 順子 written with 涉 and 頁, glossed as 孝子, a filial child. Shirakawa takes this to reflect a rite performed at a ford or waterside—places of passage where people worshipped their parents—perhaps also resonant with ancient water burials. From a character denoting solemn worship, its core sense became to yield to or follow the divine will; in time this broadened to the general meanings “to follow” and “to obey,” further extending to qualities such as being gentle, honest, and correct."
