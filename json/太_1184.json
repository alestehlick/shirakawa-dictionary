  "explanation": "Shirakawa treats 太 as a phono-semantic graph in which 大 serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on reading tai, and as an abbreviated form of 泰. The older form 泰 combines 大 (a person seen from the front with arms and legs outstretched), 収 (the two hands set side by side), and 水 (water), depicting both hands lifting someone up from the water. From this scene arise senses such as peaceful and gentle, and by extension rich, abundant, great, and very. In 太, the small dot beneath 大 is a shorthand for the 水 of 泰, preserving that origin. Early texts often do not distinguish clearly among 泰, 太, and 大, though usage later settled: 太 is the choice in compounds like 太極 (the principle that structures the cosmos), 太古 (remote antiquity), 太子 (the Crown Prince), and 太陽 (the sun). In Japanese it also carries the native readings futoi and futoru, as in ‘a thick tree’ or ‘to grow fat.’"
