  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the silk/thread element evokes dyed textiles, while the component 工 supplies the sound (kō). The Shuowen defines it as “the red-white color of silk,” a red softened by a touch of white, like the pink of peach blossoms. In use it names the dye colors beni and kurenai—vivid, deep reds—and can also mean simple red. This term belongs to the world of dyeing, in contrast to mineral reds such as 丹 (cinnabar) and 朱 (vermilion), which are geological pigments."
