  "explanation": "New is a compound graph built from 辛, 木, and 斤. 辛 is a large, handled needle used for divination; 木 is a tree; 斤 is an axe. In the ancestral rite evoked here, a diviner casts the sacred needle to let the gods indicate a particular tree. That tree is then cut with an axe to make a mortuary tablet. Because this is a freshly felled, divinely chosen tree, the character came to mean “new” and “beginning.” The practice parallels the ritual of shooting a sacred arrow and building where it lands to mark the site of important constructions. Related characters preserve facets of the same scene: 親 shows one bowing before the newly made mortuary tablet, hence “parent,” the newly revered person in the ancestral line; 薪 names the leftover wood used as firewood in the festival. Thus 新 remembers a sacred choosing, first cutting, and the sense of fresh inception."
