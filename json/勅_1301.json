  "explanation": "This character brings together 束, the image of brushwood tied in a bundle, with 力, the plow. In its older counterpart 敕, 束 is paired with 攴 (攵), the sign of striking or arranging. The composite evokes a purification rite in which a bundle of brushwood is handled—set in order, even struck—so that disorder is corrected. From this ritual sense of putting things right arise the meanings “to admonish” and “to correct,” and, by extension, the graph came to denote an imperial command. Today 勅 serves as the standard form for that older 敕, and it is used for ‘mikotonori,’ the emperor’s edict, and for words connected with affairs of the Son of Heaven."
