  "explanation": "The character is historically written 淚 and is a later, picto-phonetic formation: the water element marks a liquid, while 戾 (modern 戻), with the sound value rei, supplies the phonetic, yielding the Sino-Japanese rui. Earlier writing expressed “tears” with a directly pictographic form that shows drops falling from the eyes; this sense is preserved in 涕, which originally could mean both “tears” and “to weep.” 淚 itself is a Han-period creation and is not recorded in the Shuowen. In Tang poetry, Du Fu often pairs 涕 and 淚 in phrases like 涕淚交交下る, “mucus and tears flow together,” reflecting the distinction that took hold in usage: 涕 came to denote nasal mucus, while 淚/涙 names the tears proper."
