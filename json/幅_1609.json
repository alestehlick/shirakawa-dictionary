  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character formed with 冨 as the phonetic, giving the on-reading fuku and evoking fullness or swelling, and 巾 meaning cloth. The Shuowen glosses it as the width of a textile (布帛), hence the basic sense of the breadth or side-length of a piece of cloth. From this concrete image arise uses like 辺幅, which first referred to the hem or edge of cloth and, by extension, came to mean one’s outward show or exterior, as in 辺幅を飾る, “to adorn one’s appearance.”"
