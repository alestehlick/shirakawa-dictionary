  "explanation": "古 is a compound sign joining 十 and 口. Here 十 is a shortened form of 干, the rectangular sacred shield, while 口 represents the covenant vessel (sai) into which written prayers to the deity were placed. Setting the shield upon this vessel signifies safeguarding and preserving the efficacy of those prayers over a long span, which gives the character its meanings of “old,” “from of old,” and “antiquity.” When 囗 (an enclosure) is added to 古, it forms 固, expressing the enclosing and firming of that preserved power—“hard, solid.” When 攴 (to strike) is added, it becomes 故, an act that violates that preservation, hence “deliberately, on purpose.”"
