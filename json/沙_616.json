  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: the element 少 functions as the phonetic, indicating the on reading sa. Shirakawa explains 少 as a figure of small cowrie shells strung together, a form that evokes small things lined up in sequence; from this image also comes 紗, the word for thin silk gauze. Within the family of “sand” graphs built on this phonetic, 砂 refers to the coarser, shell-like grit, while 沙 names the fine sand characteristic of beaches near the shore."
