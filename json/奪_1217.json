  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 奪 as a figure built from the upper half of the garment sign 衣 (rendered as 大), the bird 隹, and the hand 又/寸, a composition clearly shown in bronze inscriptions. It depicts a hand reaching into clothing to catch a bird trying to escape, an image he connects with a funerary rite to keep the bird‑shaped soul from fleeing the deceased’s garments. From this act arise the senses “to catch,” “to seize,” and by extension “to take by force” or “to rob.” He compares it with 奮, which shows the bird’s legs pinned by a device (the 田 element) to hold it within the garment; the bird’s struggle there yields meanings like “to flutter” and “to rouse, brandish.”"
