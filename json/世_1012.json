  "explanation": "In its early form, 世 pictures a fresh bud pushing out from branching boughs. The element 生 shows the sprouting shoot of a plant; the graph 枼 depicts three new branches spreading from a trunk, and 葉 is the foliage that appears upon them. From this image of new leaves emerging in succession, the character came to evoke the span of a human life, successive generations, and, by extension, an age or the human world—the society formed by people."
