  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains 郷 as a compound pictograph. In the old forms, 卯 depicts two people seated facing one another, and beside it appears the gui (ki), a ritual food vessel used to serve offerings after ancestral worship. Together they picture the banquet held after the rites: two people confronting each other with the vessel set between them, which gave rise to senses such as “to face” and “banquet” (kyoen). From this ceremonial setting, 卿 came to denote the high-ranking guests invited to such feasts, and 郷 the territory under those ministers. To signal that territorial meaning, later scribes added the settlement element on both sides, creating the present form and distinguishing it from 卿; in antiquity the two graphs were the same. In later usage 郷 came to mean one’s native village and countryside, the home district."
