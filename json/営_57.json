  "explanation": "Originally written 營, this is a phono-semantic character. In early forms the upper element depicts a safeguard fire kept burning before military quarters or the palace as a protective signal, while the lower part, shaped like 呂, stacks two square 口 to suggest the floor plan of barracks or palace rooms. From the scene of strenuous activity and organized effort in such settings, the character came to mean to conduct, manage, and carry on affairs. The phonetic element provides the on-reading ei."
