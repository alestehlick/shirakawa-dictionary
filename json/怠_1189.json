  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: 台 provides the on reading tai and, in Shirakawa’s view, originally evokes a ritual in which a sai—a covenant vessel for prayer slips—was set upon a plow, the tool being purified and exorcised to petition the gods for a bountiful harvest. The same 台 appears in 怡, “to rejoice,” celebrating such bounty. By contrast, 怠 names the mindset that leans on divine favor—asking rather than exerting—thus “to neglect, to be idle,” and in compounds like 怠慢, “negligence,” colored by 慢 “to make light of, to look down on.” The graph is also used in place of 殆 “danger” in some versions of the Analects passage “to think yet not learn is dangerous,” where 怠 appears for 殆."
