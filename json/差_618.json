  "explanation": "In bronze inscription forms, this character combines 禾 (grain such as rice and millet) with 左 or 右; in particular, 左 functions as a phonetic giving the sound sa. The graph originally depicts presenting grain in ritual, offering it to the deities. From the act of judging the quality of what was offered arose the sense of selecting, and because stalks of rice and millet vary in height, the idea broadened to unevenness (as in 参差), then to differ, discord, and difference. Later the form was reshaped under the influence of a graph for offering a sheep in sacrifice, which led to the present shape being taken as a phonosemantic character. In Japanese usage it extends to verbs such as sasu, including presenting or submitting something and holding up an umbrella."
