  "explanation": "安 combines 宀, the roof of the ancestral mausoleum, with 女, a seated woman. It portrays a new bride visiting her husband’s ancestral shrine, revering the forebears, receiving the family’s clan spirit, and through this rite being accepted into the lineage. Protected by the ancestors, she may live in peace and ease—hence the character’s original sense of calm and of calming. Early forms even record ritual details: wine sprinkled for purification, and a small thread at the bride’s hem, a garment sign marking her entrancement by the ancestral power, an idea that echoes the “true bed” investiture of Japanese myth. From this core meaning of serenity, the later Japanese sense “cheap” is a secondary development. Related graphs extend the same motif: 按 shows calming by pressing with the hand, while 晏 depicts the woman worshipping in the mausoleum with a spiritually potent jade set upon her head, augmenting her spirit and expressing a heart at peace and in happiness."
