  "explanation": "In its earliest form, 互 is a pictograph of a device for winding up rope. As the Shuowen notes, it is something with which a rope can be put away. The action of alternately looping the cord above and below while holding the middle part gives rise to the idea of turn-taking and reciprocity, which yields senses such as kogo (in turn) and sogo (mutual). From the same notion comes the term gokun, “mutual glossing,” for pairs of characters that interpret one another—for example, glossing 宮 (palace) with 室 (room), and in turn glossing 室 with 宮."
