  "explanation": "曰 is a pictograph of slightly lifting the lid of a ritual covenant vessel (sai) to inspect the prayer slips placed within. In this vessel the gods’ response was believed to manifest, and the inner sign 日 marks the divine message or revelation. Thus 曰 originally signifies words spoken with sacred authority—the pronouncement of the gods. This is why formulas like 子曰く, “The Master said,” were treated as solemn proclamations, once read notamawaku in the elevated style, akin to the honorific phrasing 詔りたまわく. Although not a general-use character today, 曰 anchors many graphs containing 日, where that element retains the nuance of a revealed message."
