  "explanation": "Originally written as 鑄, this character took 壽 (ju) as a phonetic to mark the on reading chuu, as seen also in 疇 and 躊. The earliest bronze-inscription forms, however, are straightforwardly pictorial: two hands hold a鬲-type vessel set over fire, a vivid image of the casting process—melting metal and pouring it into a mold. The Shuowen glosses it as “to liquefy metal,” and the character is used for actions such as iru and ikomu, casting metal into a prepared mold. With the later addition of 壽 as a phonetic element, the graph settled into a phono-semantic form."
