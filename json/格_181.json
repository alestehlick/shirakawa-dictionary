  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character with 各 as its phonetic core, 格 draws on an early form in which covenant writings were placed in a ritual vessel to summon the gods, and the gods were implored to descend—hence the sense “to come,” seen in the term raikaku for divine descent. From the belief that affairs are set right under divine will arose the meaning “to rectify; correct,” reflected in kakugen, admonitory words. Because what is right often meets resistance and accusations can make matters twist, the word also came to suggest “to get entangled; to pick a quarrel,” like branches and twigs catching one another—hence kakutou, grappling. By structural analogy to branching, it further denotes a framework, as in kokkaku, the skeletal frame."
