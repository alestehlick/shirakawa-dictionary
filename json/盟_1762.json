  "explanation": "盟 is a compound of 明 and 血. In Shirakawa’s reading, 明 evokes moonlight streaming through a window—the sacred opening where the gods were revered. Joined with 血, it denotes the solemn rite of sipping blood to seal a vow before the deities, hence the senses “to swear” and “oath.” In the Zhou period, such oaths affirmed innocence in grave cases, and feudal lords gathered every twelve years to exchange mutual pledges of alliance. In compounds like 盟約, 約 alludes to displaying the terms of a promise by the number or form of knots tied in a cord, while related oath imagery includes the sacred gesture of breaking an arrow. Archaeological testimony comes from the Hóumá oath documents from the Jin capital—thousands of pieces written in vermilion on jade and stone—recording cooperative covenants within a clan, all reflecting the character’s original, ritual sense."
