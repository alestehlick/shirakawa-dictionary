  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: the component 舟 ‘ship’ provides the meaning, while 監 (On reading kan) supplies the sound. Medieval lexica describe it as a ship fitted with a plank-built “house” on deck—an enclosed structure erected to protect against arrows—hence a purpose-built warship. Such vessels became prominent from the Three Kingdoms period, when campaigns were waged across the broad Yangtze. The phonetic 監, ancestral to 鑑, originally referred to a large water basin used as a ‘water mirror,’ and here contributes both its sound and a water-bound resonance to the character’s formation."
