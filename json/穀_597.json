  "explanation": "穀 is a phono-semantic character. In early forms, the element 殼 functions as the phonetic, pointing to the on-reading and sketching the husk left after threshing — an empty shell with scraps still clinging inside. With 禾, the grain plant, added, the whole graph presents cereal grains enclosed in their husks, and so came to mean cereals and grain in general. A related figure, 穆, shows the grain-bearing ear swelling and about to burst, reinforcing the image of ripening crops. Because cereals sustain human life, the character naturally extends to the senses of nourishing, rearing, and living."
