  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the left element 阝 (fu) originally depicted the ladder used by the gods to descend and ascend, and by extension evoked the act of being seated together at a sacred place—being at someone’s side. The right element serves as the phonetic, giving the sound bai; in early forms it showed a ripened fruit about to split open, a motif associated with breaking open and an increase in number. Taken together, the graph expresses being alongside another, as when many sit at the side of a superior (陪席), and it extends to the senses of following and attending on someone of higher rank (陪従, 陪食), the status of a subordinate or retainer (陪臣), and participation alongside specialists in judgment (陪審). Thus 陪 centers on the idea of accompanying, attending, and standing by another’s side."
