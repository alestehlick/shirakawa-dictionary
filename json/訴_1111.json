  "explanation": "A phono-semantic graph: 言 marks speech, while 斥 functions as the phonetic, giving the on reading so. In early usage the character also appears as 愬, which employs 朔 as its phonetic; 朔 contains 屰, an inversion of 大—a figure with limbs outstretched—depicting someone coming from the opposite side. The Shuowen glosses it as “to tell, announce” (告), so the core sense is to come forward and report one’s case, hence to appeal or lodge a complaint, a meaning seen in legal compounds such as 訴訟."
