  "explanation": "Originally written 驗, this is a phono-semantic graph: the horse element supplies the scene of divination, while 僉 serves as the phonetic and links the word to other graphs like 檢 (検) and 險 (険) that share its on-reading. 僉 itself depicts two worshipers dancing in ritual, each presenting a container into which written prayers to the gods are placed. 験 thus names the moment when a response to such prayer is shown. The horse was chosen because it was thought especially quick to receive divine inspiration, and ceremonies that tested the gods’ will through horses were performed—Japan too held shrine horse races from ancient times. From this setting the character came to mean testing or trying something out, investigating, and, by extension, a manifest sign, proof, or the effective result of a prayer."
