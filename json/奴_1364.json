  "explanation": "Composed of 女 “woman” and 又, the shape of a hand, 奴 depicts a woman being seized, and from that image developed the sense of a captured woman—hence a servant or slave. Early sources note that in antiquity those found guilty of transgression were made nuhi, slaves dedicated to divine service: crime was understood not simply as a legal offense but as ritual defilement, a breach of taboo, so offenders were tattooed and compelled to serve the gods. Records speak of many such slaves attached to shrines, and captives taken from other tribes were likewise reduced to servitude. In later usage the graph appears in scolding compounds such as 守銭奴, applied disparagingly to a miser."
