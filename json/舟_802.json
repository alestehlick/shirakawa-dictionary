  "explanation": "A pictograph of a boat. In antiquity, boats were dugouts hollowed from single logs, shaped like shallow troughs; their outline matches the basin or plate used to hold food or water. Because this same boat-shaped tub served in acts of giving and receiving, 受 shows hands placed above and below such a vessel. In 癒 (“to heal”), the right-side element depicts lancing an affected spot with a handled knife and letting the fluid drain into this tub; there, the component written as 月 is not flesh but the very basin form. In early script, the sign for the receiving tub and the sign for the boat afloat on water are essentially the same figure."
