  "explanation": "祉 is a phono-semantic character: the left side is 礻 (the altar hand of 示), signaling matters of divine favor and ritual, while the right side 止 supplies the sound shi. The Shuowen already glosses it as akin to 福, “good fortune,” and in compounds like 福祉 it denotes welfare and happiness. In the Book of Odes it appears in lines such as “he received the blessing of the god” and “they deigned to bestow this happiness,” showing that 祉 originally evoked happiness as a boon conferred by the gods—a blessing granted through sacred favor rather than mere happenstance."
