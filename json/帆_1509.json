  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the left element 巾 depicts cloth, while 凡 serves as the sound element. Shirakawa notes that 凡 is an old form related to 盤 and already functioned as a phonetic indicator in the oracle-bone form of 風. Here, the cloth component shows a sheet catching the wind to drive a boat, giving the concrete sense of a sail and, by extension, sailing craft such as the hokake-bune. As river and coastal navigation expanded—especially in Jiangnan from the Three Kingdoms era onward—large sailing vessels were built, and even letter-writing reflected this world, with greetings like 布帆恙無し, “the cloth sail is without mishap,” wishing safe passage. In the same phonetic series, 汎 carries senses such as “to float” and “broad,” resonating with the imagery of water and wind gathered in 帆."
