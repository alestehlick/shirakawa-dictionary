  "explanation": "組 is a phono-semantic character: the silk element points to threadwork, and the phonetic 且 gives the on reading so. Early lexica define it as a kind of braided cord (kumihimo), classed among the 綬; a small one served as a crown cord. A slender, tightly plaited cord was called 纓, while 綬 named the larger type. Because a braid is formed by bringing many threads together, the character naturally extended to the ideas of assembling and combining—hence compounds like 組織, originally the interlacing of threads to make a whole and by extension an organized body, and 組繡, embroidered work. From the concrete image of a braid arose the general senses “to construct, to put together,” and “a pair or set.”"
