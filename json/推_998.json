  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the hand on the left signals a manual act, while the right-side bird graph (隹) supplies the on-reading sui and evokes bird augury. That bird element, seen also in characters like 惟, 進, and 誰, belonged to the sphere of divination, and 推 likely arose in that context as the act of drawing conclusions from signs—hence meanings such as ‘to infer’ or ‘to suppose.’ From this core idea the sense expanded to ‘pushing things forward,’ that is, advancing or promoting a matter. A celebrated Tang anecdote further anchored the character in literary culture: the poet Jia Dao vacillated between writing 僧推月下門 (‘the monk pushes the gate under the moon’) and replacing 推 with 敲 ‘knock’; this scrupulous choice gave rise to the idiom 推敲, now meaning to polish and refine one’s writing."
