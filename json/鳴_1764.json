  "explanation": "鳴 combines 口 and 鳥. Here 口 is not a mouth but sai, a ritual receptacle that held covenant writings offered to the gods, while 鳥 depicts a phoenix-like sacred bird lifting its head to cry. Together they picture prayer and divination conducted through the bird’s call. From this sacred image of a bird crying grew the everyday senses of animals calling and, more broadly, of sounds that ring out and resound."
