  "explanation": "An indicative sign born from the old system of wooden counting rods: a single horizontal rod stood for “one,” while a single vertical rod marked “ten.” The character 十 records that vertical ten-sign. In bronze inscriptions the vertical stroke sometimes carries a thick dot at its center, a style that later yielded the form 士. Higher decades were built additively from these rod signs—廿 for “twenty” by aligning two tens, and “thirty” by combining three 十. From this base arose administrative and counting usages such as 什, denoting a unit of ten—ten people, ten poems, or ten households considered as one set—paralleling 伍 for a five-household unit."
