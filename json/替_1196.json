  "explanation": "In its earliest form this character was written as 普, combining 竝 (並), the figure of two people standing in line facing forward—the accuser and the accused—and 日, which indicates a written oath placed in a sacred covenant vessel (sai). It evokes the scene of a trial in which the parties vow before the gods; when the disputation ends, the loser is cast aside, giving rise to the sense “to throw away.” From there the meaning broadened to “to replace” and “to alternate,” as in 交替 and 隆替, conveying substitution and the cycles of rise and decline."
