  "explanation": "揮 is a phono-semantic character: the hand radical signals an action of the hand, while 軍 serves as the phonetic, giving the on-reading ki. In early script, 軍 shows a flag streaming from a vehicle—a banner waved to muster troops—so 揮 originally evoked the hand wielding such a flag. In that martial context, 発(發) meant shooting arrows at the outset of battle to announce an attack, and 揮 was the waving of the flag to mobilize; both were terms of military signaling. The sense later broadened to shaking, wielding, or moving the hands, and by extension to ‘display,’ as in 発揮 ‘to bring out, to demonstrate.’ The same phonetic 軍 also appears in 暉 and 輝, which share the reading ki. In literary usage, 揮毫 names the elegant act of wielding the brush to write or paint."
