  "explanation": "A pictograph of a tongue thrusting out from the mouth, this character originally depicted the organ itself. In oracle-bone inscriptions the tip is drawn split, like a snake’s, emphasizing a lively, flickering motion rather than a static human tongue. From this vivid image it naturally came to signify speech and words. Oracle records even include divinations concerning illnesses of the tongue. A Han-era anecdote tells of Dong Ai, who copied passages onto his palm and memorized them by licking them—nicknamed “tongue learning”—a curious reminder of the tongue’s intimate link with the acquisition of words."
