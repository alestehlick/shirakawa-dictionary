  "explanation": "A pictograph of the entrance to an underground room. In the loess belt of northern China, where the thick yellow earth made conventional roofing difficult, people often lived in semi-subterranean dwellings: a deep rectangular pit was dug, with horizontal chambers extending from it in four directions, or rooms were carved directly into cliff faces. Shuowen glosses it as “a chamber in the earth.” The character sketches the mouth of such a chamber—the simple diverging strokes indicate the opening—and from this image it came to mean a hole, and by extension a cave or cavity."
