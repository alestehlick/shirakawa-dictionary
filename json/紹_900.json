  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 紹 as a phono-semantic graph with 召 providing the sound (On sho). In bronze inscriptions it appears in phrases like 紹種皇祖皇帝, “to continue the line of the imperial ancestors,” expressing the idea of following the founders’ path and inheriting their office; 種 here carries the sense of lineage and succession. Early bronze forms also write the character as 邵: the element 卩 depicts a kneeling worshiper, set beside a ritual ‘sai,’ a covenant vessel that receives written prayers to the gods. The scene is one of reverent offering to invite the descent of the departed spirit and to meet it, and from this ritual context the character’s core meanings—succession and accession—arise. Hence 紹 comes to mean to carry on or take over, and, by extension, to introduce or link on another’s behalf."
