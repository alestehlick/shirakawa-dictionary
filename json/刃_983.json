  "explanation": "Shirakawa takes 刃 as a pictograph: a knife with a small flash of light at its cutting edge, a graphic glint that singles out the sharp part of the blade. In the Shuowen this is the “hard knife,” showing the knife and the biting “tooth” of its edge, and so the graph names the blade, the edge, and by extension the toothed edge of tools and cutlery (as in hamono). No distinct ancient forms are recorded."
