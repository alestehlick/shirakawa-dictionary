  "explanation": "池 is a phono-semantic character: the water radical indicates water, while 也 serves as the phonetic, giving the On reading chi. The same 也 appears in characters like 地 and 馳, likewise signaling chi. In usage it often referred to man-made waterworks—ditches or basins—hence meanings such as “pond” and, by extension, “moat,” seen in compounds like 池苑, 池亭, and 城池. The graph 也 was originally shaped like a snake, suggesting a sinuously bent form. A later cultural vignette recalls the Han calligrapher Zhang Zhi, the “Grass Sage,” who practiced by rinsing his brush in a pond; as its waters darkened with ink, it was dubbed the “Ink Pond” (墨池)."
