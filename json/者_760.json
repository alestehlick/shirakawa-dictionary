  "explanation": "In Shirakawa’s view, 者 depicts an earthwork. Branches are piled up above the sun sign 日 and coated with earth 士; in early graphs a small dot marks the covering soil that seals and hides what lies within. Such clay fences once encircled villages, and a covenant charm was buried in their midst—a receptacle holding prayer texts to the deities. The characters inscribed on this talisman give rise to 書, formed by placing the brush sign 聿 over 者, originally denoting sacred writing used for exorcism. The same earthwork image underlies 堵 “clay wall,” expands to 都, a walled city, and 京, the arched city gate—hence names like 京都 and 京師 for a fortified capital. From an original sense of an earthwork and the act of concealing, 者 later shifted to mean “person,” and it now functions as an agentive suffix in compounds such as isha, gakusha, and shisha."
