  "explanation": "This character is a compound graph that places the fingertips (爪) above the form of a kneeling person (卩). It pictures firmly pressing down from above—an act of holding something in place. From this concrete image it came to signify the act of pressing down a seal, and by extension the seal itself and the stamped mark in general."
