  "explanation": "This character began as a pictograph of an animal’s horn, clearly seen in the oracle-bone and bronze forms. It could denote pulling or handling an animal by its horn, in contrast to 牽, which shows leading an ox with a rope, the element 玄 depicting the cord. From the projecting, pointed nature of a horn arose senses for a corner or angle, things with sharp edges, and by extension a square with four right angles; the image of animals locking horns also fostered meanings of contention and competition. The original form lives on in ritual bronzes of the Shang and Zhou periods, where a horn-shaped wine vessel was called 角."
