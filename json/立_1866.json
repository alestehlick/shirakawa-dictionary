  "explanation": "This graph combines 大 and 一. 大 sketches a person seen from the front with arms and legs outstretched, and 一 marks the fixed spot. Together they depict someone standing at a designated place, giving the core sense “to stand” and, by extension, “to take one’s position.” From this image arises 位, the idea of the place where one stands—rank or station—and the verbal sense “to face” or “to be present.” In bronze inscriptions 立 is already used in these extended meanings, overlapping with 位 (place, rank) and with graphs such as 滥 or 莅 (ri), meaning to look out upon, border on, or attend. In later compounds like 設立 and 創立 it naturally develops the sense “to found” or “to establish.”"
