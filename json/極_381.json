  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character, 極 takes its sound from 亟, which points to the on readings kyoku and goku. Shirakawa sees 亟 as formed from elements suggesting a narrow gap with a person forced in, a covenant vessel (sai) set in front bearing a curse text, and a hand pressing from behind—together depicting a method of shutting someone in for punishment. Pushed to its utmost, that punishment becomes 殛, execution; 亟 is the original graph of 殛. 極 names the site of such execution, a dead-end terminus, and from this idea of reaching the farthest point it came to mean to carry something to the limit (kiwameru), to reach an extreme (kiwamaru), the height or apex (kiwami), and by extension the ultimate or finest grade, as in gokujo."
