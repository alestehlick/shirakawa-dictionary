  "explanation": "Originally written 蠻, this is a phono‑semantic character: the phonetic part signals the sound ban, while its early form drew on a ritual image. In bronze inscriptions the graph without the insect component was used for this word, and its core depicted a covenant receptacle into which the words of an oath to the gods were placed, adorned with thread decorations—hence the presence of the silk element 絲 in the old form. The sense “southern savage” arose as a loan on the basis of that sound value; later, the insect/snake element 虫 was added because southern peoples were imagined as serpent‑like tribes. By contrast, northern non‑Chinese groups were called 狄. From this background the character came to be used for ideas such as roughness, wildness, and uncivilized behavior."
