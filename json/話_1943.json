  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 話 as a phono-semantic graph: the left side 言 marks speech, while the right side 舌 supplies the sound and preserves an ancient ritual image. In early forms, 舌 depicts a small handled blade thrust into a covenant vessel (sai) that held written petitions to the gods; by piercing and scraping them away, the prayer’s power was annulled. Built on this image, 話 originally evoked speech that cuts and harms—words of censure, slander, or malicious talk. From there its use broadened to ordinary speaking and conversation. Its phonetic kin, such as 訛 and 獪, likewise cluster around senses of deceptive or crafty speech, confirming this early nuance."
