  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: 潘 supplies the on-reading han and, as a word meaning “white water” (the water in which rice has been rinsed), functions here as the phonetic. Early glosses already define 藩 as a 屏, a fence or screen, and in use it names rough, woven enclosures—a fence or hedge (kaki/kakine, magaki) and a boundary. From the protective role of such fencing, the sense broadened to a protected, governed territory, hence “feudal domain,” as in 藩士 and 藩主. The graph is also used in place of 蕃 (“to grow thick, to increase”) and 樊 (“brushwood fence”)."
