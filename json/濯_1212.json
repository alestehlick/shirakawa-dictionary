  "explanation": "濯 is a phono-semantic character: the water element (氵) supplies the field of meaning, while the phonetic 翟—originally the figure of a bird raising its wings to take flight—contributes sound and an image. In early imagination, that bird beats its wings against the water’s surface, suggesting the action of splashing and rinsing. From this vivid scene the graph came to mean washing or rinsing, and later broadened to general washing. By contrast, 洗 originally pictured purifying the feet in a tub of water. Together they form 洗濯, the laundering of clothes—also evoking the idea of washing away hardship for a refreshed, lightened feeling."
