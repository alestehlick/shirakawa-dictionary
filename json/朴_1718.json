  "explanation": "朴 is a picto-phonetic character: 木 “tree” supplies the semantic field, while 卜 cues the On reading boku. The Shuowen defines 朴 as the bark of a tree, rooting the graph in the notion of unworked, natural wood. From this base it came to express plainness and unaffected simplicity, as in compounds like soboku and junboku. The fuller form 樸 is glossed in the Shuowen as wood material—raw timber—and is often used interchangeably with 朴 to convey the same sense of basic, unadorned nature. In Japanese, 朴 also names the ho (ho-no-ki), Magnolia hypoleuca, preserving the image of straightforward, natural wood."
