  "explanation": "A pictograph of the moon, portrayed not as a full disc like the sun 日, but as the waxing three-day crescent chosen to set it apart. Because the moon waxes and wanes, the slender early crescent captured its characteristic change. The old shape also lies behind 夕 “evening,” which originally resembled the moon appearing at dusk. In oracle-bone forms the drawing varies by period, yet consistently shows the three-day crescent. In bronze inscriptions, 月 bears a dot while 夕 does not; in the modern script, 月 carries two small interior strokes, distinguishing it from 夕 with only one. From this image the character came to mean both the visible moon and, by extension, the month."
