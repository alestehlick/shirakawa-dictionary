  "explanation": "This character combines three elements: 彳, the side of a crossroads, evoking a road; 幺, a twisted thread bundle used as a ritual curse implement (as seen in the old form of 禦); and 夊, footprints turned backward. Together they depict a rite in which a thread-bundle charm is employed to compel an enemy to retreat. From this image of driving someone back arise the senses of “back/behind,” “to move back,” and, by extension, “later/after” and “to be late.”"
