  "explanation": "The original form is 歷, a phono-semantic compound. The component 麻 serves as the phonetic for reki and, in Shirakawa’s view, depicts two trees set up beneath a cliff to make a military gate—an emblem of the army’s headquarters. The element 止 is a footprint, conveying stopping or returning. Together they evoked what one went through in military service and the tallying and review of meritorious deeds on campaign. From this sense of tracing and reckoning came later uses meaning to pass (as time passes) and to count or calculate."
