  "explanation": "Shirakawa explains that the earliest form of 東 depicts a sack tied at the top and bottom. That figure, however, was pressed into service not for its original sense but as a phonetic loan to write the direction “east,” at a time when the script lacked native graphs for east, west, and south. To express the meaning “bag” explicitly, scribes later created the phono-semantic 橐 (“taku”) by adding the sound-marking element 石—an on-reading marker also seen in 宕 (to) and 拓 (taku). The portion of 橐 without 石 corresponds to the old shape of 東. In Japanese the character also reads azuma, as in 東歌 (azumauta)."
