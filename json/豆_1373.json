  "explanation": "A pictograph of a stemmed bowl raised on a tall foot—a ritual vessel used to hold salty condiments or ceremonial drink, typically made of wood or ceramic. In later usage the graph was borrowed to write tō (adzuki bean), in place of the plant-form character 荅, and thus it came to bear its familiar sense of “beans, peas.”"
