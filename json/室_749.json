  "explanation": "室 joins the roof sign 宀 with 至. The roof is that of a mausoleum, a place where ancestral spirits were venerated. 至 depicts an arrow turned downward to mark the exact spot where it has landed—the site chosen in an old ritual: a sacred arrow was loosed from a fixed point, and where it came to rest became the place to build. By placing the roof over this “arrived-at spot,” the character portrays the chamber raised there for ancestral worship. From this ritual sense it broadened to mean a room in general, and by extension a house, household, or family. Characters such as 屋 and 臺 (台) also incorporate 至, reflecting the same practice of determining a building site by the arrow’s fall. In Japanese, this origin lingers in usages like 氷室 (himuro), an ice cellar—literally a “chamber” for preserving winter ice."
