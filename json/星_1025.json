  "explanation": "Shirakawa interprets 星 as a phono-semantic character: 生 functions as the phonetic element indicating the on-reading sei. In early forms the upper part shows 晶, a cluster of 日 marks; here each 日 does not depict the sun but a star, and 晶 conveys the sparkle of many stars shining together. From this imagery the character comes to mean “star.” Classical texts such as the Book of Odes mention the Weaver Star (Vega) and the Big Dipper, and later astronomical terminology shows influence from the West—Southwest Asia and Egypt—with names for Jupiter like 赤奮若 and 摂提格, and the term 歳星, preserving phonetic transliterations from those languages."
