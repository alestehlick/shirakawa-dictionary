  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the water sign on the left combines with the phonetic 罙 (read shin). In the old forms, 罙 shows a torch lowered into a cavity, the image of lighting and searching within an enclosed chamber used in ancestral rites. With the hand radical, this same graph yields 探, “to search,” the act of probing a hole by firelight; with water instead, it becomes 深, evoking the notion of probing into water—hence “deep water.” From this concrete scene the meaning broadened to “deep, profound,” and by extension it came to be used for senses such as excelling, strictness, and the lateness of the hour."
