  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 存 as a compound of 才 and 子. 才 depicts the crosspiece fixed atop a landmark tree raised as a sacred signpost; in ancient rites a covenant receptacle for petitions to the gods was attached to such a pole, a prototype that also underlies 在. Adding 士—the head of a small broadax used as a sacred implement—to 才 yields 在, affirming a place as sanctified and truly present. In 存, by contrast, 子 is joined to 才, picturing a child placed under that consecrating sign. It conveys a child being hallowed so that his life is preserved, and from this it comes to mean to be, to exist in a consecrated state, to live, and to keep. By extension it also covers inner intention and regard, as in 存心 (thought held in the heart) and 存問 (inquiring after someone’s condition). Even 存在 originally suggested presence established through sanctification and purification, not mere factual existence."
