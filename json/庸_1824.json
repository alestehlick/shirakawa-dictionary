  "explanation": "Shirakawa reads 庸 as a compound of 庚 and 用. He sees 庚 as the figure of a person grasping a pestle, the tool used to pound, thrash, and polish grain, while 用 depicts a wooden palisade or frame. Brought together, they evoke packing earth into that wooden frame and tamping it firm with the pestle to form a solid wall or rampart—hence the original sense “fence.” The graph later came to be employed in place of 用 and so also acquired the meaning “to use.” To represent the older sense explicitly, 墉 was created by adding the earth element. In subsequent usage, 庸 broadened further to mean “usual, common,” “average,” and even “stupid.”"
