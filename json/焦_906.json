  "explanation": "焦 combines the short‑tailed bird 隹 and fire 火, originally evoking the act of setting a bird to the flame—adding fire to roast or scorch it. The Shuowen records a form glossed as “shō” specifically for roasting many birds. From this vivid scene the sense broadened to the general “roast, burn, scorch,” and then shifted figuratively to the mind’s heated agitation, as seen in compounds like 焦心 and 焦慮 and in the Japanese reading aseru “to be impatient.” The related form 憔 likewise draws on this core idea of burning."
