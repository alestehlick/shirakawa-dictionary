  "explanation": "This compound graph brings together the roof of an ancestral hall (as in 完 and 寇), 元 depicting the head or neck with the cranium accentuated, and 寸 indicating the hand. In the ancient form it shows the hair of the head being bound by the hand and a coronet placed upon it beneath the shrine’s roof—the rite of guan/kanmuri, the coming‑of‑age investiture (冠服, guànfú; ganpuku) that marked a young man’s entry into adulthood. Because it is something set on the head, the character naturally came to mean a coronet or crown, and by extension “the highest” and “to excel.”"
