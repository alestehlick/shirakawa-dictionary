  "explanation": "Shirakawa traces 疑 back to an older form written 矣, depicting a person leaning on a cane who turns to look behind, stopping in indecision—torn between going forward or turning back. An intermediate stage adds the figure of the person turning back to 矣, and the later graph 疑 further introduces an extra leg, sharpening the image of wavering between advance and retreat. From this picture of bewildered hesitation grew the senses of doubting and being puzzled: it began as an inward struggle over whether to proceed, and later broadened to the general idea of harboring suspicion toward others."
