  "explanation": "This character depicts the radiance of the stars. By arranging the sun/star element three times, it intensifies the image of light, yielding senses such as clear and shining. The related graph 昌, which combines two of the same element, already conveys burgeoning brightness and prosperity; with three, the brilliance is heightened. Old forms of 星 even show a variant that places 生 beneath 晶, underscoring its link to starlight. Because the light of stars is brilliance without heat, 水晶 (rock crystal) names a substance that gleams with that cold, lucid light."
