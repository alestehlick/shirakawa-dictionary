  "explanation": "This graph combines the signs for water and a dish, depicting water spilling over the rim of a plate. From that image of overflowing came the senses of growing, adding, and rising—what exceeds the vessel—and so it develops the meanings “increase,” and by extension “benefit, gain, profit, abundance.” It also serves as the base graph for 溢 (itsu), “to overflow.”"
