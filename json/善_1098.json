  "explanation": "This character is a compound ideograph built from a sacred sheep and two instances of the speech element 言. In its archaic form, 言 did not simply mean “speech”: it pictured a tattooing needle 辛 set over a covenant vessel (sai) that held prayers to the gods, and thus signified words sworn before the divine—oaths made under penalty of tattooing if broken. Placing two 言 on either side of 羊 evokes the accuser and the accused taking oaths on the occasion of a divine ordeal, with the sacred sheep—likened to the discerning ‘divine dissection sheep’ (解廌)—set between them as judgment was sought. Originally a juridical term for this oath-taking rite, the graph came to express fulfilling the divine will, hence “good” and “right,” and by extension “excellent,” “skillful,” and even the sense of being on good terms."
