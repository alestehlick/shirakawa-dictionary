  "explanation": "曜 is a phono-semantic character: the sun graph 日 supplies the meaning of light, while 翟 serves as the phonetic that carries the yō reading and belongs to a family of graphs expressing brilliance—compare 燿 and 耀, which share this phonetic and the sense of glittering radiance. Traditional glosses define 曜 as shining or sparkling, specifically the sun’s own dazzling light, as in the Book of Odes line 日出有曜, “when the sun rises, there is brightness.” From this image of radiant sunlight, the character extended to celestial luminaries and, in modern usage, to the days of the week (曜日), each day named after a shining body in the sky."
