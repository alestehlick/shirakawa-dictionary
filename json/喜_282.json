  "explanation": "In its ancient form, 喜 combines the graph of a drum—beaten in ritual performance—with the sign of a sacred receptacle used to hold written prayers to the gods. It evokes a full festival scene: praying, drumming, singing, and dancing to gladden the deities. From this image of rejoicing offered to the gods, the sense was later transferred to human feeling, coming to mean to be glad, to rejoice, and to enjoy."
