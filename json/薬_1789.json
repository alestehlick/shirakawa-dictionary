  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the grass radical signals medicinal herbs, while the inner element 樂 (楽) serves as the sound marker, yielding the on reading yaku. Shirakawa notes that this sound reflects an older value that shifted in the same way seen when 勺 “shaku” becomes 約 “yaku” and 釋 “shaku” becomes 訳 “yaku”; related graphs like 鑠 also preserve the older shaku. The Shuowen defines it as “grass that cures illness,” hence its core senses of medicine and healing by medicine. Shirakawa further interprets 樂 as the form of a handbell with a handle, and sees the ancient image behind 薬 as a shamaness ringing that bell to drive out the spirits of disease—an origin that explains both its herbal component and its reading as a vestige of the era when shamans were the healers."
