  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character formed with the water element on the left and 良 as the phonetic, 浪 takes its sound from 良, marking the on reading rou. While the Shuowen identifies it as the name of the Canglang River, in usage it denotes the swell and surge of water—waves and billows—likely echoing the sound of moving water. From this image of restless motion it broadened to mean unrestrained or disorderly movement and aimless drifting, which underlies compounds such as 浪費 “waste,” 放浪 and 流浪 “wandering.”"
