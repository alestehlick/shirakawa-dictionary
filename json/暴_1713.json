  "explanation": "In the ancient script, 暴 combines the sun with the figure of an animal’s corpse, evoking a body laid out under the sun to bleach. From this vivid image came the sense of exposing or laying bare—hence “to disclose” and “to reveal”—and, by the sudden way a sun-dried carcass reveals bone, the ideas of “at once,” “sudden,” and “to come into view.” In usage it broadened to describe rough, unruly behavior, as in compounds like 暴虐 and 乱暴. A related graph, 曝, which further emphasizes the sun element, later specialized in the concrete sense of “to bleach” or “to expose to sunlight.”"
