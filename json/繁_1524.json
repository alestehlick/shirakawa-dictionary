  "explanation": "This character is a compound of 敏 and 糸. In early forms, 敏 shows a finely adorned woman with a hand reaching to her hairpieces, the act of arranging hair ornaments for sacred rites—a scene that conveys devoted, diligent attentiveness. By adding 糸, the threads and cords of further ornamentation, the graph evokes luxuriant, abundant hair decorations. From this image of richly layered adornment, the sense extends to abundance and frequency: many, flourishing, growing dense and thick. In turn, the notion of things occurring often broadened to suggest matters becoming complicated or busy."
