  "explanation": "A phono-semantic character: the person radical on the left marks a human agent, while the right side is 尞/寮, which supplies the sound ryō and evokes stacked wood set alight—a watch fire used during night guard, as in the courtyard beacon 庭燎. From this imagery, 寮 came to denote the sacred office where such a watch fire was maintained. With the person element added, 僚 originally named someone who served in that office, and by extension came to mean an official or a colleague sharing the same duties. The Book of Documents uses 百僚, “the hundred officials,” as a collective term for the bureaucracy."
