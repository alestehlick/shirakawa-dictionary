  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 恩 as picto-phonographic. The upper 因 serves as the phonetic element (on-reading in) and originally depicts a mat (the cushioned mat, inseki) on which someone lies. Because such a mat is something constantly used and intimately familiar, adding 心, “heart,” shifts the idea to affectionate care. Thus 恩 expresses heartfelt love and the favor or grace one receives from such kindness."
