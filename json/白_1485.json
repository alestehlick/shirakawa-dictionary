  "explanation": "Shirakawa sees 白 as a pictograph of a skull whose flesh has fallen away, bleached by wind and rain until it becomes white bone; from that stark image the sense of “white” arose. In ancient practice the skulls of outstanding leaders or slain enemy chiefs were kept as dokuro (skulls), believed to concentrate formidable spiritual, even cursing, power; from this aura of authority comes the title 伯, “chief.” The character is also used with the sense “to say” (mosu), for formally stating or reporting something."
