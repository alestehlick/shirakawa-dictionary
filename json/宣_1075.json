  "explanation": "宣 combines 宀, the roof of a sacred hall or mausoleum where ancestral spirits were revered, with 亘, a graph that often evokes a semicircular span. In early usage, 宣 named the senshitsu, the semicircular pre-chamber of the palace, a space for hearings, trials, and solemn rites. Bronze inscriptions such as the Guoji Zibai Pan record executions of the Xianyun and the献馘 rite of presenting an enemy commander’s head performed in this chamber. Because pronouncements issued from there, the character took on the sense of publicly proclaiming or making known; in Japanese it yields noberu “to state” and notamau “to say” (honorific), and later also came to mean “clear, manifest.”"
