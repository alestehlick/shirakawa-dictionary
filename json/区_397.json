  "explanation": "In its original form 區, the character shows an enclosed, hidden sacred precinct within which three ritual ai vessels are set out—containers for written petitions to the gods. The image is of a secluded place of prayer where many such receptacles are lined up. From this ritual scene, related graphs arose: 欧 portrays raising the voice in supplication, and 殴 depicts striking the vessel to press one’s plea. Because prayer took place within a small, bounded enclosure, 區/区 came to mean a delimited section or ward, and by extension the act of marking off or apportioning space."
