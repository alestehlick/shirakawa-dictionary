  "explanation": "Originally written as 聲, the graph shows a suspended stone chime (磬) being struck, set beside an ear to depict sound as it is heard. In oracle-bone and bronze forms a small “sai” element appears below—the shape of a ritual receptacle that held covenant texts offered to the gods—indicating a prayerful summons and revealing that the chime served to call the deities. From this scene the character first meant sound and echo; later it came to denote the human voice and, by extension, rumor."
