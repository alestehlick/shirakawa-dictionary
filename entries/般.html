    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound character formed from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舟.html">舟</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舟.html">舟</a> does not depict a boat but the shape of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="盤.html">盤</a>—a tub, bowl, or plate used to hold and carry things—while <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span> conveys the act of striking. In this configuration, the vessel is understood as a sound-making implement: <span class="kanji-inline">般</span> originally pictured beating a plate as an instrument, which lends it associations of enjoyment (as in <span class="kanji-inline">般</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="楽.html">楽</a>) and, by extension, of turning over or going round (as in <span class="kanji-inline">般</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="旋.html">旋</a>). <span class="kanji-inline">般</span> is in fact the earlier form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="盤.html">盤</a> and is often used in the same way; from this base the meaning broadened to the familiar sense of “general, all, various,” seen in compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="一.html">一</a><span class="kanji-inline">般</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="諸.html">諸</a><span class="kanji-inline">般</span>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="先.html">先</a><span class="kanji-inline">般</span>.</p>
