    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa takes <span class="kanji-inline">琴</span> as a phono-semantic graph. In seal script it pictured the entire koto, but later the drawing was pared down to highlight the stretch of strings, and the phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">今</span> (read kin) was added to yield the present form. The koto, fashioned from carefully chosen paulownia wood, was a sacred instrument used to summon the gods. Early kotos commonly had five or seven strings; much larger zithers with twenty-five, fifty, or more strings were called <span class="kanji-inline">瑟</span> (shitsu). From their harmonious pairing comes the expression <span class="kanji-inline">琴</span><span class="kanji-inline">瑟</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="相.html">相</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="和.html">和</a>, which likens the blending of koto and shitsu to the mutual harmony of husband and wife.</p>
