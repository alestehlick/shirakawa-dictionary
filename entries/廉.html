    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">廉</span> is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">兼</span> as its phonetic, which signals the on-yomi ren and belongs to a group where an earlier k- element drops in Sino-Japanese; similar patterns are seen with graphs built on <span class="kanji-inline">監</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="各.html">各</a> that yield ran and raku. The Shuowen glosses it as “to incline,” from which the sense of a slanted edge or “corner” arose; out of the idea of holding firmly to the corner developed the moral meaning of straight, incorrupt conduct, as in <span class="kanji-inline">廉</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="直.html">直</a>. In <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="清.html">清</a><span class="kanji-inline">廉</span> the nuance of “pure, free of selfish desire” is a borrowed extension from a homophonous word meaning “clear.” The character also came to mean “inexpensive,” as in <span class="kanji-inline">廉</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="価.html">価</a>.</p>
