    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">謹</span> as a phono-semantic graph: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, “speech,” joined with <span class="kanji-inline">堇</span>, which gives the on-reading kin and conjures an ancient ritual scene. <span class="kanji-inline">堇</span> depicts, in times of crop failure, a shaman bearing a sai—a covenant vessel for written prayers—set upon the head, the hands crossed and bound, offered in a desperate rite to invoke rain. With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> added, the character marks the solemn words of supplication voiced in that moment, speech measured to appease divine anger. From this core, <span class="kanji-inline">謹</span> comes to mean conducting oneself and one’s words with careful restraint, humility, and respectful deference.</p>
