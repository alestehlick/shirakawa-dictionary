    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">魅</span> as a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="未.html">未</a> functions as the phonetic, signaling the on reading mi, while the body is <span class="kanji-inline">鬼</span>, the ghost-demon. Early forms also incorporate the hair-strokes <span class="kanji-inline">彡</span>, emblem of a thickly haired, uncanny being—much like the long‑haired monster implied in <span class="kanji-inline">彪</span>—evoking mononoke and sudama, spirits thought to dwell in mountains, forests, trees, and stones. In Zhou and old-script shapes, the lower element is animal-like and approaches the form of <span class="kanji-inline">祟</span> “curse,” suggesting a dread apparition feared for bringing calamity. From this image of a bewitching presence that seizes the heart arose the later sense of enthralling or leading the mind astray, as reflected in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">魅</span><span class="kanji-inline">了</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">魅</span><span class="kanji-inline">力</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">魅</span><span class="kanji-inline">惑</span>.</p>
