    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">聞</span> is a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a> functions as the on-reading indicator, while the core image centers on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="耳.html">耳</a>, the ear. In oracle-bone script it depicts a large ear above a person stretching up on tiptoe, emphasizing the ear’s capacity to catch sound. People once believed the ear could receive the gods’ faint voices—hence <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="聖.html">聖</a>, the person able to hear divine revelation. Another early bone form shows a hand raised to the mouth, suggesting formal address to the Son of Heaven (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="以.html">以</a><span class="kanji-inline">聞</span>). In bronze inscriptions, an ear is paired with the ritual wine cup <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="爵.html">爵</a>, evoking offerings and prayer made to discern the gods’ will. By the Warring States period the graph settled as <span class="kanji-inline">聞</span> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a> added as the phonetic. From the original notion of hearing the gods’ voice, the sense broadened to ordinary ‘hear, listen,’ and in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">聞</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="望.html">望</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="声.html">声</a><span class="kanji-inline">聞</span> it also came to mean ‘fame, honor.’</p>
