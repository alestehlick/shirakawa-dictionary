    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">勉</span> as a phono-semantic compound with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="免.html">免</a> as the phonetic. He takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="免.html">免</a> (with the on value men) as depicting the posture of childbirth—an image of straining effort—and <span class="kanji-inline">力</span> as the form of a plow, evoking agricultural labor. Joined together they convey sustained exertion in fieldwork, and from there the broader sense of making every effort: to strive and work diligently (tsutomeru). The character thus comes to suggest spurring oneself on or encouraging diligence, and in compounds points toward studied application.</p>
