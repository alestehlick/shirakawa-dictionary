    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">任</span> is a picto-phonetic character: the person radical <span class="kanji-inline">亻</span> combines with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">壬</span>. In ancient forms, <span class="kanji-inline">壬</span> depicts a stout stand set into an earthen floor, used when forging metal and shaping vessels—its thickened middle shows something made to withstand heavy force and weight. Placed beside <span class="kanji-inline">亻</span>, it portrays a person capable of bearing a load and standing up to pressure, which naturally extends to taking charge, attending to tasks, and shouldering responsibilities. From this image arise the senses “to entrust/leave to someone,” as in<span class="kanji-inline">委</span><span class="kanji-inline">任</span>, along with ideas of duty, service, and work. <span class="kanji-inline">壬</span> also supplies the on reading for the character.</p>
