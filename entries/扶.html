    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">扶</span> is a phono-semantic character: the hand on the left signals the act of giving support, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夫.html">夫</a> provides the sound fu and also evokes the person being steadied. Bronze inscription forms depict hands bracing a man from the side, a clear image of assistance. Ancient glosses already define it as helping and as offering support and protection, and in use it covers both ‘to help’ and ‘to guard.’ It shares reading and sense with <span class="kanji-inline">輔</span> and appears in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">扶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="助.html">助</a> (hojo, assistance). The character also figures in <span class="kanji-inline">扶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="桑.html">桑</a>, the mythic Fusang tree in the far east from whose branch the sun was believed to rise, later a poetic name for Japan.</p>
