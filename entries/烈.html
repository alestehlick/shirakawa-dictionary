    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">烈</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="列.html">列</a> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="火.html">火</a>. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="列.html">列</a> originally depicts a corpse whose head has been cut off, the head and body set apart; when fire is added, the graph evokes the burning of those remains, and by extension the force of something violent, vehement, and stern. The Shuowen glosses it as a wild blaze, underscoring the fierce power of a conflagration. In bronze inscriptions the form appears as <span class="kanji-inline">剌</span>, the image of a knife cutting open a loaded sack (<span class="kanji-inline">柬</span>) so that the contents burst forth; this writing was borrowed for <span class="kanji-inline">烈</span> and gave rise to a secondary use meaning distinguished service or merit, seen in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="功.html">功</a><span class="kanji-inline">烈</span> and in honorific titles such as <span class="kanji-inline">烈</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="祖.html">祖</a>, which extol ancestral virtue and authority.</p>
