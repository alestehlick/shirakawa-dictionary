    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">刻</span> is a phono-semantic character built on the knife radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a> and the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">亥</span>. Shirakawa notes that <span class="kanji-inline">亥</span>, seen also in words like <span class="kanji-inline">骸</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="核.html">核</a>, evokes something whose inner framework is laid bare. Because <span class="kanji-inline">亥</span> originally depicted an animal, the graph pictures slicing up an animal carcass with a knife—hence the core sense “to cut finely, to engrave.” From the image of flaying and stripping flesh came associations of severity and harshness. And since time was once reckoned by incising notches on instruments, the character naturally extended to mean “time, hour,” as in jikoku.</p>
