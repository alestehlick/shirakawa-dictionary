    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">回</span> as a pictograph of water whirling in a deep place—a pool or eddy seen from above. From this image of circling flow arise the senses of turning, revolving, and rotating, and by extension the idea of returning to where one began. He aligns <span class="kanji-inline">回</span> with related graphs formed on the same imagery: <span class="kanji-inline">淵</span> depicts the deep pool where water gathers and swirls, and <span class="kanji-inline">洄</span> shows the act of water circling back on itself. This shared motif was felt even in classical naming, as with Confucius’s disciple Yan Hui (<span class="kanji-inline">顔</span><span class="kanji-inline">回</span>), whose style name Ziyuan (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a><span class="kanji-inline">淵</span>) pairs <span class="kanji-inline">回</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">淵</span>—both evoking water that turns round and round.</p>
