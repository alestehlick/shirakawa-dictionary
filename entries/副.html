    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: the element read fuku depicts a swollen-bellied vessel, evoking the idea of being filled, while the knife component indicates cutting. In ancient usage this pointed to dividing a full sacrificial offering—specifically tearing open the breast—into two portions. From this ritual apportionment arose the contrast of principal and secondary: the second share became the reserve that accompanies the main one. Hence the character’s senses of “secondary,” “assistant,” and by extension “copy,” “reserve,” and “to accompany/comply,” as seen in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="正.html">正</a><span class="kanji-inline">副</span> (principal and secondary) and <span class="kanji-inline">副</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="本.html">本</a> (a copy of a book).</p>
