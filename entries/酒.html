    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">酒</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water radical on the left marks a liquid, while the right side, <span class="kanji-inline">酉</span>, originally depicts a wine cask and by itself once meant “sake.” Related graphs illuminate its ritual setting. <span class="kanji-inline">酋</span> adds the sign <span class="kanji-inline">八</span> above the cask to show the alcoholic vapors rising—“old, well-matured sake.” <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尊.html">尊</a> shows the wine cask being held with both hands and set before the gods, and <span class="kanji-inline">樽</span> names the wooden cask itself. In the Yin and Zhou periods, bronze ritual vessels were often wine vessels, and inscriptions frequently record <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="作.html">作</a><span class="kanji-inline">寶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尊.html">尊</a><span class="kanji-inline">彝</span>, “to make a precious revered ritual vessel,” underscoring wine’s central place in sacrificial rites; tradition even held that the Yin dynasty later fell through excess in drink.</p>
