    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form is <span class="kanji-inline">亂</span>. It depicts thread (yo) wound on a reel (kei), with the strands in a tangle. Hands are shown above and below (<span class="kanji-inline">爪</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>, both archaic hand forms) working to tease the knots apart, and a bone spatula (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="乙.html">乙</a>) serves as the tool used to loosen and straighten the threads. From this graphic scene the character expressed both the state of being in disorder and the deliberate act of restoring order. The later vulgar form <span class="kanji-inline">乱</span> became the standard, and it now stands for <span class="kanji-inline">亂</span> with both senses.</p>
