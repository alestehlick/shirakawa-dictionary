    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">最</span> as a compound: <span class="kanji-inline">取</span>, which shows an ear <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="耳.html">耳</a> and a hand <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a> and originally meant taking an enemy’s left ear as proof of a kill, set beneath <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a>, understood here not as the moon but as a hood or cover. The graph evokes many such ears being gathered and covered from above, giving the senses of taking and collecting. Compare <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="撮.html">撮</a>, “to pinch up,” which likewise expresses taking with the fingertips. Because military merit was reckoned by the number of ears taken, <span class="kanji-inline">最</span> came to signify the highest achievement, and by extension ‘the foremost’ and ‘most, extremely,’ alongside its older senses ‘to take’ and ‘to collect.’</p>
