    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="歩.html">歩</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">步</span>) and <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span>. In ancient practice, the waterside was a sacred place where deities were welcomed, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="濱.html">濱</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">浜</span>) originally referred to rites carried out at the shore. The component <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span> shows a person in profile with garments and headgear properly arranged for ceremony, so <span class="kanji-inline">瀕</span>—and by extension <span class="kanji-inline">頻</span>—evokes rites performed at the water’s edge. In bronze inscriptions, the graph written for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="順.html">順</a> appears as <span class="kanji-inline">瀕</span>, indicating a ceremony honoring one’s parents by the water; the expression <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="順.html">順</a>(<span class="kanji-inline">瀕</span>)<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a> referred to a model of filial piety. Viewed together—<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="濱.html">濱</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="順.html">順</a>(<span class="kanji-inline">瀕</span>), and <span class="kanji-inline">瀕</span>—these forms attest to festivals and funerary customs observed beside water, including water burial. In later usage, the sense shifted to what happens again and again: “frequent, often.”</p>
