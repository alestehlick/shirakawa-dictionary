    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">財</span> is a phono-semantic compound. <span class="kanji-inline">貝</span> portrays the revered koyasugai—shells from the southern seas associated with safe childbirth—which, being extremely precious, served as ancient currency and thus signal valuables. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a> supplies the sound sai and also suggests “material.” Together they denote valuable goods—money, wealth, treasure. By phonetic extension, <span class="kanji-inline">財</span> was also used for the senses of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">纔</span> (“a little”), and of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="裁.html">裁</a> (“to judge or cut out; to plan, consult”), as reflected in forms like <span class="kanji-inline">財</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="察.html">察</a> (“settling a case”) and <span class="kanji-inline">財</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="成.html">成</a> (“managing, handling”).</p>
