    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">曹</span> is a compound that combines <span class="kanji-inline">棘</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">日</span>. In early forms <span class="kanji-inline">棘</span> consists of two <span class="kanji-inline">東</span> set side by side; and <span class="kanji-inline">東</span> itself originally depicted a sack used in ritual, a sense later preserved by creating <span class="kanji-inline">橐</span> when <span class="kanji-inline">東</span> came to be used for the direction “east.” In ancient judicial practice, plaintiff and defendant deposited bundled arrows and a specified weight of gold into such a ritual sack, swore an oath, and placed the written vow in a covenant casket. <span class="kanji-inline">曹</span> portrays this moment when the offerings and oath are complete and the case can commence, and by extension names the officials who conduct the proceedings. From there it came to mean an office or bureau, and collectively the circle of people involved in a matter, hence usages such as <span class="kanji-inline">法</span><span class="kanji-inline">曹</span> and administrative terms like <span class="kanji-inline">曹</span><span class="kanji-inline">局</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">曹</span><span class="kanji-inline">司</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">曹</span><span class="kanji-inline">署</span>, with later Japanese developments including <span class="kanji-inline">曹</span><span class="kanji-inline">司</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">御</span><span class="kanji-inline">曹</span><span class="kanji-inline">司</span>.</p>
