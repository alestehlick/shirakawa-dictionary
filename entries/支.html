    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">支</span> is a compound graph that joins the sign for a small tree-branch with the hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>), picturing a hand grasping a twig. In early usage it served as the original character for “branch” (later written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="枝.html">枝</a>), set in contrast to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="本.html">本</a> “root,” and thus came to mean what splits away from the main line: a branch, to branch off, or to divide. This contrast is echoed in the term <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="干.html">干</a><span class="kanji-inline">支</span>, “trunk and branches,” for the sexagenary cycle. Because wooden branches are used to prop things up, the character naturally also took on the sense “to support,” as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">支</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="持.html">持</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">支</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="柱.html">柱</a>.</p>
