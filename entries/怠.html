    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: <span class="kanji-inline">台</span> provides the on reading tai and, in Shirakawa’s view, originally evokes a ritual in which a sai—a covenant vessel for prayer slips—was set upon a plow, the tool being purified and exorcised to petition the gods for a bountiful harvest. The same <span class="kanji-inline">台</span> appears in <span class="kanji-inline">怡</span>, “to rejoice,” celebrating such bounty. By contrast, <span class="kanji-inline">怠</span> names the mindset that leans on divine favor—asking rather than exerting—thus “to neglect, to be idle,” and in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">怠</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="慢.html">慢</a>, “negligence,” colored by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="慢.html">慢</a> “to make light of, to look down on.” The graph is also used in place of <span class="kanji-inline">殆</span> “danger” in some versions of the Analects passage “to think yet not learn is dangerous,” where <span class="kanji-inline">怠</span> appears for <span class="kanji-inline">殆</span>.</p>
