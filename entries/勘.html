    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa understands <span class="kanji-inline">勘</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="甚.html">甚</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a> is not “strength,” but the form of a plow (<span class="kanji-inline">耒</span>), and the whole graph evokes the act of rubbing or sharpening the plow against a block—the kind of solid, resonant implement also associated with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="甚.html">甚</a>, as in the fulling block <span class="kanji-inline">碪</span>. From this image of careful grinding and adjustment came the sense of deliberate examination: to check and weigh matters, and by extension to think and consider. In this vein, the character also expresses the work of collating and testing a text to judge whether a character or phrasing is correct.</p>
