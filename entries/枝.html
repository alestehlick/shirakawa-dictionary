    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa traces <span class="kanji-inline">枝</span> back to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="支.html">支</a>, a graph that shows a hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>) holding a small twig, and which originally meant a branch. As <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="支.html">支</a> later broadened in use to mean supporting or dividing, the wood element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> was added to make the tree-sense explicit, creating <span class="kanji-inline">枝</span>. The character is thus phono-semantic: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> signals the domain of wood, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="支.html">支</a> (read shi) provides the sound and the idea of something that extends from a main body. This is the nuance heard in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">枝</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="葉.html">葉</a>, the branches and leaves of a tree, and even in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="四.html">四</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肢.html">肢</a>, the limbs that branch from the trunk of the body.</p>
