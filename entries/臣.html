    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">臣</span> as a pictograph of an upturned eye with an emphatically large pupil, a form seen in the oldest scripts. In the Yin dynasty, the xiaochen—royal scions assigned to sacred duties—served in divine rites. Among those who attended the gods were people whose pupils were intentionally injured to deprive them of sight; in related graphs a hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>) is shown entering the eye, marking this ritual blinding. Such blind ritual specialists (gusha) were regarded as <span class="kanji-inline">臣</span>, attendants devoted to the deities. From this sense of serving the gods, the character later came to mean a retainer in service to a ruler and, more broadly, anyone who serves.</p>
