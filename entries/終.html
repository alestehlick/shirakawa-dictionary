    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">終</span> as a phono‑semantic character formed by the thread classifier <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a>, giving the sense of “thread,” and the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="冬.html">冬</a>. In its ancient form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="冬.html">冬</a> depicts the tied ends of knitted yarn and originally wrote the idea of an “ending.” When <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="冬.html">冬</a> later came to designate only the season “winter,” the thread element was added to restore the earlier sense, yielding <span class="kanji-inline">終</span>. From the image of tying off loose ends arise meanings such as ending, finishing, and bringing things to a conclusion—reflected in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">終</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="結.html">結</a> (conclusion) and <span class="kanji-inline">終</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="始.html">始</a> (from beginning to end)—and by extension it can also mean “at last, finally.”</p>
