    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">賞</span> as a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尚.html">尚</a> (also seen in early connections with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="商.html">商</a>) supplies the on reading shou, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>, the shell used as currency, marks the idea of valuables given as a reward. In bronze inscriptions the act of bestowing a prize appears as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="商.html">商</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>, literally “to grant shells.” From a graph showing this bestowal, forms with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a> added under <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="商.html">商</a> produced <span class="kanji-inline">賈</span> and then developed into the present <span class="kanji-inline">賞</span>. Its primary sense is to bestow a reward, hence ‘prize’ and ‘grant,’ and by extension it came to include ‘compensation’ and the praising sense seen in words like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="褒.html">褒</a><span class="kanji-inline">賞</span>.</p>
