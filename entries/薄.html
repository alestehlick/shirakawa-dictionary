    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">薄</span> is a phono-semantic character built with <span class="kanji-inline">溥</span> as its phonetic. The inner graph <span class="kanji-inline">尃</span> shows a hand setting a seedling to cover its roots, and in bronze inscriptions it appears in expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">尃</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a>, conveying the act of spreading or promulgating commands and, by extension, letting things extend widely. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">溥</span> carries the sense of breadth and amplitude. With this as its phonetic base, <span class="kanji-inline">薄</span> came to mean “thin,” as in the Book of Odes line “as if treading on thin ice” (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="如.html">如</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="履.html">履</a><span class="kanji-inline">薄</span><span class="kanji-inline">冰</span>). By extension it can also denote “few, scant,” “base or paltry,” “to despise,” and is at times used with the sense “to approach,” standing in for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="迫.html">迫</a>.</p>
