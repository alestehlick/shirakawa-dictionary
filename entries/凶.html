    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">凶</span> as a pictograph of a funerary body painting. The lower enclosure sketches the chest, and the cross marks the cinnabar-red pattern brushed onto the breast of the newly deceased while an incantation was recited, a charm to keep malignant spirits from entering the corpse. Because this rite belonged to the moment of death, the graph came to signify what is inauspicious and unfortunate. From this base, adding <span class="kanji-inline">勹</span>, the outline of the whole body seen from the side, produced <span class="kanji-inline">匈</span> “chest,” which with the flesh element <span class="kanji-inline">月</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肉.html">肉</a>) became <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="胸.html">胸</a>; adding <span class="kanji-inline">儿</span>, the form of human legs, gave <span class="kanji-inline">兇</span>, “an evil person.”</p>
