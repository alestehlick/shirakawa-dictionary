    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character joins the person radical with the garment <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衣.html">衣</a>, picturing clothing placed upon a person. In early belief, when a spirit was received or passed on, the human spirit was thought to inhabit the garment; a spirit-imbued robe would be drawn close to someone in a ritual of spirit transfer. From this act of drawing near arose the senses “to rely on” and “to approach.” Echoes of the idea remain in Japanese tradition: the “true bedclothes of inheritance” and the heavenly feather robe worn by the sovereign at the Daijosai after accession are spirit-charged vestments. Early scripts preserve the same imagery: in some archaic forms of characters such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="安.html">安</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="保.html">保</a>, hooked threads added to the sleeves of a woman or a child mark a spirit-possessed garment, and oracle-bone forms of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衣.html">衣</a> even write a person within the robe, suggesting that in ancient rites one literally hid inside the garment during the transfer.</p>
