    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Although early oracle-bone or bronze forms are not attested, the seal-script shape preserved in the Shuowen suggests a jade girdle-pendant: pieces of jade hanging from a waist belt with additional ornaments suspended below. As an image of a pendant set in which every component is present and beautifully arranged, the graph came to signify being fully furnished and in perfect order—hence the meanings “complete,” “entire,” and “all.” Early lexicography even associated it under the jade radical as “pure jade,” reflecting the ideal of flawless workmanship that underlies the character’s sense of wholeness.</p>
