    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the heart radical signals an inner, emotional state, while <span class="kanji-inline">每</span> (mai/kai) serves as the phonetic and carries imagery. <span class="kanji-inline">每</span> originally depicts a woman with elaborate hair ornaments, evoking a head made heavy and overburdened—a disagreeable, oppressive feeling that shades into “darkness.” That nuance also appears in characters like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="海.html">海</a> (sea) and <span class="kanji-inline">晦</span> (dark), which share <span class="kanji-inline">每</span> as their phonetic. Applied to the heart, this gloom becomes the feeling of repentance and regret expressed by <span class="kanji-inline">悔</span>. In the compound <span class="kanji-inline">悔</span><span class="kanji-inline">恨</span> (kaikon), <span class="kanji-inline">恨</span> uses <span class="kanji-inline">艮</span>, a figure of a person retreating before a threatening eye, adding a sense of recoiling disappointment. In Japanese usage, kuyamu can be used in mourning or condolence, while kuyashii conveys a mortified, vexed regret.</p>
