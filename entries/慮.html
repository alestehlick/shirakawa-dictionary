    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats <span class="kanji-inline">慮</span> as a phono-semantic graph: the phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">呂</span> points to the On reading ryo, while the character expresses the act of careful thought—“to plan and think,” as the Shuowen glosses it—hence omonpakaru, to consider. The phrase <span class="kanji-inline">弗</span><span class="kanji-inline">慮</span><span class="kanji-inline">弗</span><span class="kanji-inline">圖</span> in the Book of Odes already uses the word in the sense of “no forethought, no planning,” showing its antiquity. Yet the specific graph <span class="kanji-inline">慮</span> does not appear in oracle-bone or bronze inscriptions; in Warring States bronze (the Zhongshan King Square Tripod), the word is written with a phonetic loan that reflects the reading, making clear that the form was not built with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="思.html">思</a>, but centered on the phonetic element from which its sound and sense of weighing matters arise.</p>
