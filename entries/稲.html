    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character. The original form is <span class="kanji-inline">稻</span>, with <span class="kanji-inline">舀</span> (tou) as the phonetic. <span class="kanji-inline">舀</span> depicts scooping something from a mortar (<span class="kanji-inline">臼</span>) with the fingertips (<span class="kanji-inline">爪</span>), and in bronze forms you can see grains scattering and spilling from the mortar. The semantic element <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span> shows the rice plant. In this way, the character comes to mean the rice plant itself. The image of spilling and overflow carried by <span class="kanji-inline">舀</span> also appears in related characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">滔</span>, “to overflow.” Bronze inscriptions frequently include dedicatory phrases like “used for serving rice and millet” on rectangular offering vessels called <span class="kanji-inline">簠</span>, showing that rice plants were presented as offerings to the gods.</p>
