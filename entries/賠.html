    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the left side is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>, the shell-money that signals payment, while the phonetic on the right (read bai) goes back to the image of a ripened pod about to split, an image associated with breaking apart and multiplying—hence “increase.” Joined together they convey compensating a loss with money, often with an amount augmented beyond the actual damage. Bronze inscriptions record cases where such reparations were paid in an increased sum, evidently as a punitive addition, perfectly matching the nuance carried by the phonetic element.</p>
