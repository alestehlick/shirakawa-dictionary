    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a compound graph combining <span class="kanji-inline">刁</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>. Shirakawa takes <span class="kanji-inline">刁</span> as a ritual implement used in worship, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> here represents the sai, a covenant vessel into which written prayers to the gods were placed. The character thus depicts the act of supplication: an officiant chanting prayers and handling the sacred tools before the prayer receptacle. From this ritual scene the meaning ‘to preside, to administer’ arose. In light of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="同.html">同</a>—understood as the prayer-vessel used when inquiring of the deities—the figure implied by <span class="kanji-inline">司</span> is the person who reads out and interprets the divine will.</p>
