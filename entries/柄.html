    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: the wood element indicates a tool, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丙.html">丙</a> serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading hei. In ancient form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丙.html">丙</a> depicts a stand or pedestal on which a spear or utensil could be set upright, and by association points to the part grasped in the hand. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">柄</span> first meant the handle or hilt of a tool. Because the handle is where one controls a thing, the sense broadened to the basis or foundation of matters, and further to authority—the power by which affairs are directed. Classical usage speaks of governing without losing this authority, and the Japanese compound ouhei (‘overbearing’) evokes looking down on others under the cover of such power (as in kenpei, ‘official authority’). In Japanese, gara developed to mean a patterned design (as on a kimono), as well as one’s family standing and personal character.</p>
