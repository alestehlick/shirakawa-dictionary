    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Left is a compound graph that joins the sign for the left hand (the original, abbreviated stroke ナ) with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="工.html">工</a>, a ritual implement used by shamans. In ancient forms, this implements appears in <span class="kanji-inline">巫</span>, which shows it held in both hands. Left thus depicts the act of prayer performed with the implement in the left hand, seeking the deities’ whereabouts and appealing for their aid (yuujo). From this ritual context, the character came to mean both “left” and “to help.” Its counterpart right shows the right hand holding the covenant vessel <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> that receives written prayers, and when left and right are stacked, they form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尋.html">尋</a>, whose earliest sense is to inquire after where the gods are. Over time, cultural ranking of sides colored usage, giving left the secondary sense of “lower” or “inferior,” as in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">左</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遷.html">遷</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">左</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="降.html">降</a>.</p>
