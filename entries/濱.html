    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">濱</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water element sets the scene at the water’s edge, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="賓.html">賓</a> (on reading hin) supplies the sound and carries a ritual image. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="賓.html">賓</a> depicts a ceremony in the ancestral hall in which the hind legs of a sacrificial animal are offered together with a shell used as a curse implement, an act of worship that welcomes the deities. Placed by water, this becomes a deity‑welcoming rite conducted along the shore, giving the senses of waterside, water’s edge, and beach. A related form is <span class="kanji-inline">瀕</span>, which uses <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="頻.html">頻</a> as the phonetic and portrays holding such a waterside ceremony while wearing ritual headgear.</p>
