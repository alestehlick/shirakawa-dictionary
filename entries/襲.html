    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines <span class="kanji-inline">龍</span>, not as a sound element but as a dragon motif, with <span class="kanji-inline">衣</span>, clothing. It evokes a dragon-patterned robe laid over other garments—originally the layering of such attire upon the clothes of the dead, and, in later rites of investiture, the ceremonial act of putting one robe over another when assuming office. From this ritual of layering came the senses of succeeding and inheriting, and in turn the later extension to attacking.</p>
