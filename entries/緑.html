    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">緑</span> is a phono-semantic character. Its original form <span class="kanji-inline">綠</span> combines the silk radical (<span class="kanji-inline">糸</span>), pointing to dyed silk, with the phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">彔</span> (read roku), which supplies the sound. The Shuowen defines it as “silk of a blue–yellow hue,” a tone between blue‑green and yellow—the shade Japanese call midori, an emerald-like green. Early literature already uses it this way, as in the Book of Odes poem Lü Yi (“Green Clothes”): “Green is the upper robe, green with a yellow lining,” confirming its association with the color and with the world of textiles.</p>
