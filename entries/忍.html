    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">忍</span> is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">心</span>, the heart, beneath <span class="kanji-inline">刃</span>, the blade. Here <span class="kanji-inline">刃</span> serves chiefly as the phonetic, pointing to the on-readings jin/nin and linking the graph to the <span class="kanji-inline">靭</span> series—seen in <span class="kanji-inline">靭</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">靱</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="帯.html">帯</a> (ligament)—where the core idea is toughness with pliancy. From the image of a strong, flexible band binding bone to bone (the quality called kyōjin, “flexible and strong”), that sense is internalized: applied to the heart and mind it becomes quiet strength, patient endurance, and self-restraint—bearing up, putting up with, even ‘lowering oneself’ when needed. Already in the Shuowen it is explained in terms of nintai, patient bearing.</p>
