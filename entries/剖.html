    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">剖</span> as a phono‑semantic compound: its phonetic element depicts a ripe plant pod about to burst, and with the knife radical (ritto) it conveys the act of cutting or forcing something open. From this vivid image come the senses of dividing, splitting, and opening. The character appears in expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">剖</span><span class="kanji-inline">判</span>, which evoke the primordial parting and opening of heaven and earth. Classical anecdotes, like the Zhuangzi’s account of Bi Gan having his chest split open, underscore the literal force of the word. The Sino-Japanese reading hō is reflected historically, though bō is the prevailing reading in modern Japanese.</p>
