    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, <span class="kanji-inline">夏</span> is a pictograph of a court dancer: a figure wearing a ceremonial coronet, both sleeves flung up, one leg thrust forward in rhythm. The association with music and dance is preserved in the names of ancient pieces such as &#x27;Nine Xia&#x27; and &#x27;Three Xia&#x27;. From the imposing appearance of these performers—their large masked faces and tall bearing—the graph also came to suggest greatness. <span class="kanji-inline">夏</span> was further used as an ethnonym for China, as in Zhongxia, and because historical states called Xia and Western Xia lay to the west or arose from western regions, the word likely first referred to peoples of the western lands. The seasonal sense &#x27;summer&#x27; is comparatively late, first attested in Spring and Autumn bronze inscriptions. A later abbreviated variant of the graph appears in the Book of Odes, sometimes even standing where the category label Ya (Major and Minor Odes) is written, hinting that among those poems were songs meant to accompany court dances and music.</p>
