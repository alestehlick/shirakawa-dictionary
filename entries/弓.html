    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A straightforward pictograph of a bow; early forms even show the bow strung. Many bow-shaped graphs share this contour and seem to echo, almost onomatopoetically, the sense of force and flexion. Because the human trunk is slightly arched, <span class="kanji-inline">弓</span> is included in <span class="kanji-inline">躬</span> “body.” In <span class="kanji-inline">射</span> “to shoot,” the element written like <span class="kanji-inline">身</span> originally depicts nocking an arrow on the bow, and with <span class="kanji-inline">手</span> (written <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a>) it expresses shooting by hand. From this core image came terms for the bow’s parts: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="弦.html">弦</a> the string, <span class="kanji-inline">弭</span> the tip or nock, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幹.html">幹</a> the bow’s body, <span class="kanji-inline">驸</span> the grip, <span class="kanji-inline">鍥</span> a bow-sickle, and <span class="kanji-inline">畏</span> the midpoint between the two bent limbs.</p>
