    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">座</span> as a picto‑phonetic character built on <span class="kanji-inline">坐</span>. In the old form of <span class="kanji-inline">坐</span>, two people sit to either side before the earth deity (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="主.html">主</a>), because they are being tried; the graph thus first pictured those lined up for judgment, and from there came to mean simply “to sit.” When such trials were held not only at shrines but also in ancestral mausolea, the sheltering roof sign <span class="kanji-inline">广</span>—depicting a mausoleum’s eaves—was added to <span class="kanji-inline">坐</span> to form <span class="kanji-inline">座</span>. With this, <span class="kanji-inline">座</span> originally indicated the sacred seat or place of judgment before the earth deity. In Japan that sense survives in counting deities or Buddhas as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="一.html">一</a><span class="kanji-inline">座</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="二.html">二</a><span class="kanji-inline">座</span>, and in the medieval za, guilds protected by temples and shrines such as the oil guild (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="油.html">油</a><span class="kanji-inline">座</span>). Today <span class="kanji-inline">坐</span> is used for the act “to sit,” while <span class="kanji-inline">座</span> designates a seat or seating space (as in <span class="kanji-inline">座</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="席.html">席</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">座</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="敷.html">敷</a>), and in Japanese usage <span class="kanji-inline">座</span> often stands in for <span class="kanji-inline">坐</span> and is read suwaru.</p>
