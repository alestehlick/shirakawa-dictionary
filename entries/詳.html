    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">詳</span> is a phono-semantic character formed with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, “speech,” and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羊.html">羊</a> as the phonetic element that gives the on reading sho; the same phonetic appears in <span class="kanji-inline">庠</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="祥.html">祥</a>. The Shuowen glosses it as “to consult in detail,” hence the senses “detailed” and “thorough.” Shirakawa links <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羊.html">羊</a> to an ancient sheep trial by ordeal in which each party offered a sheep and their statements were carefully heard; within that ritual context, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羊.html">羊</a> came to suggest exhaustive inquiry and attentive hearing. Combined with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, the character thus conveys speech examined and weighed with care—setting matters out, or inquiring into them, in full detail.</p>
