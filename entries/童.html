    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character. In bronze inscriptions, the lower part is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="東.html">東</a>, originally the shape of a bag (the form of <span class="kanji-inline">橐</span>), which functions as the phonetic and gives the on reading do. The early upper element combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辛.html">辛</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="目.html">目</a>, depicting a large tattooing needle above the eyes—the mark of judicial tattooing. The character thus first referred to a person bearing such marks, treated as a slave or servant. Because people so marked were not permitted to wear a chignon, the graph naturally extended to children, who likewise did not wear their hair in a topknot, and <span class="kanji-inline">童</span> came to mean “child.” The “servant” sense later shifted to <span class="kanji-inline">僮</span>, as in <span class="kanji-inline">僮</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="僕.html">僕</a>. In later script forms the lower component sometimes follows <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="重.html">重</a>, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="里.html">里</a> as an abbreviated shape.</p>
