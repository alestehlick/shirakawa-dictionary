    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">勇</span> as a phonetic–semantic graph that pairs <span class="kanji-inline">甬</span> with <span class="kanji-inline">力</span>. The element <span class="kanji-inline">甬</span>, originally the picture of a bucket, serves as the phonetic and is the same component seen in <span class="kanji-inline">涌</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">湧</span>, words for water welling up from a spring. <span class="kanji-inline">力</span> is the form of a plough, evoking the kind of concentrated exertion needed to work the fields in one sustained push. Together they suggest power rising from within and being applied in a single, unhesitating effort to see a task through—hence the senses of bravery and strength. In Japanese this becomes the lively isamu “to be in high spirits,” as in the over-eager step of <span class="kanji-inline">勇</span>み<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="足.html">足</a>.</p>
