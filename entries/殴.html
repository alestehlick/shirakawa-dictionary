    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains the original form as <span class="kanji-inline">毆</span>, a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">區</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">區</span> evokes a hidden sacred enclosure where numerous covenant vessels (sai) holding written petitions are set before the gods, while <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span> is the long cane-like pike used in ritual. To “<span class="kanji-inline">殴</span>” is to strike with that pike in front of the divine—an emphatic gesture meant to press the spirits to heed and fulfill the prayer—whence the senses “to beat” and “to strike.” Related graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">歐</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="欧.html">欧</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">謳</span> share the phonetic and suggest the chant-like voice of prayer that accompanies the rite.</p>
