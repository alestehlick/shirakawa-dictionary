    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form is <span class="kanji-inline">發</span>, combining <span class="kanji-inline">癶</span>, which shows both feet poised to move—an attitude of ready departure—with a bow and <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>, the hand wielding a striking implement. Together they depict the first arrow loosed to announce the opening of hostilities. From this inaugural shot comes the core idea of initiating movement or action: to start, to depart, to send forth or emit, and, by extension, for something latent to come into the open—events breaking out, matters being discovered or invented, and feelings or secrets being revealed or expressed.</p>
