    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Formed from the bird graph <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span> and the hand graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">隻</span> depicts a bird held in the hand and thus means a single bird. The Shuowen glosses it as “one bird.” In oracle-bone inscriptions it often appears as a verb meaning “to catch,” in contexts such as catching an elephant or seizing a western Qiang captive. After a separate graph, <span class="kanji-inline">雙</span>, was created to show two birds, <span class="kanji-inline">隻</span> took on the contrasting sense of one, single, and by extension alone, and it became a counter for individual items such as birds and ships.</p>
