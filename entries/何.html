    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">何</span> as a phono-semantic character. In its oldest forms it depicts a person turning back with mouth open, as if calling out to ask—“what? where?” The component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="可.html">可</a> functions as the phonetic indicator for ka and also evokes the act of petitioning the gods for approval, a nuance that accords with the character’s role in expressing inquiry and doubt. Some oracle-bone forms show a man carrying a halberd (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>), indicative of “to carry,” which he treats as a separate lineage from the interrogative <span class="kanji-inline">何</span>. From this base the graph came to serve broadly as the general interrogative for ‘what?, where?, which?, when?’ and related senses.</p>
