    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the right element marks the sound ryō and originally depicted a sacred structure for receiving the descending deity, with backward-pointing footprints indicating the god’s descent. In some bronze forms a <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> component—also the base of <span class="kanji-inline">社</span>, “shrine”—is added to stress the idea of a place of worship. The left element is the hill radical, visualized by Shirakawa as a stepped ascent or “ladder of the gods” for moving between heaven and earth. Taken together, <span class="kanji-inline">陵</span> denotes a sacred elevation set where mountains meet the plain, a site prepared to welcome and venerate the divine spirit. From this it came to mean a hill, and, because imperial tombs were commonly established on such heights, a mausoleum (misasagi). Through graphic interchange with <span class="kanji-inline">凌</span>, it is also used with the senses “to endure” and “to surpass.”</p>
