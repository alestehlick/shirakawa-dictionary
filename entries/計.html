    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats <span class="kanji-inline">計</span> as a later compound first noted in the Shuowen; since no oracle-bone or bronze forms are known, its earliest shape cannot be fixed with certainty. From its on-yomi kei he envisions an affinity with <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span>, divination, in which one tallies the recorded hits and misses, and with <span class="kanji-inline">稽</span>, the act of pondering and comparing. In this light, <span class="kanji-inline">計</span> belongs to the realm of reckoning and deliberation—used for counting, calculating, laying plans, and thinking things through.</p>
