    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">快</span> is a phono-semantic character: the heart radical (<span class="kanji-inline">忄</span>) joined with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">夬</span> (kai). Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">夬</span>—earlier written like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="支.html">支</a>—as a hand holding a blade, an image of scraping or scooping. From this same action comes <span class="kanji-inline">缺</span>, the ‘scraping out’ of a pottery vessel, the source of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="欠.html">欠</a>. In <span class="kanji-inline">快</span> the idea is that once swellings or abscesses were cut open and the illness cured, the heart became easy and light—hence “pleasant.” He parallels this with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="愉.html">愉</a>, which depicts cutting and draining pus and blood into a tub, bringing true relief; thus <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="愉.html">愉</a><span class="kanji-inline">快</span> originally meant the ease felt after being freed from sickness. Because restored health renews vigor, <span class="kanji-inline">快</span> also lends a sense of briskness and speed in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">快</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="走.html">走</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">快</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="足.html">足</a>.</p>
