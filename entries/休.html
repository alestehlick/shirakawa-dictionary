    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">休</span> is a compound of a human figure and a tree-like post. In the earliest inscriptions, the “tree” is written as <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span>: the paired wooden standards set up on either side of a military camp’s gate. That gate was the site of solemn rites—oaths were sworn, peace was negotiated (as reflected in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="和.html">和</a>), and distinguished warriors were formally honored. <span class="kanji-inline">休</span> evokes this moment of investiture and reward, and so originally carried the sense of auspicious joy and felicitous approval. In the Zhou period, rewards such as shells or horses were sometimes accompanied by official leave from service, and from that practice the later, familiar meaning “to rest” arose.</p>
