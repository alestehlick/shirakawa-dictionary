    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">娠</span> combines the woman radical with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">辰</span> (read shin). <span class="kanji-inline">辰</span> is originally the character behind <span class="kanji-inline">蜃</span>, the clam, drawn as a creature stretching out its “legs” and moving; from this image it carries the sense of motion. In <span class="kanji-inline">娠</span> that motion is the stirring of a child in the womb, giving the meanings “to conceive” and “to be pregnant.” Earlier pictographs that express the same idea include <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="身.html">身</a>, a profile of a person with a distended belly, and <span class="kanji-inline">孕</span>, which writes the embryo within the belly of a standing woman. In the compound <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="妊.html">妊</a><span class="kanji-inline">娠</span>, the companion graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="妊.html">妊</a> takes <span class="kanji-inline">壬</span> (jin) as its phonetic, a form showing the swollen middle of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="工.html">工</a> like a tool’s block, and thus focuses on the swelling of a woman’s belly—another facet of the state named by <span class="kanji-inline">娠</span>.</p>
