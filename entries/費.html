    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">費</span> is a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>, the shell that signifies wealth and property, provides the sense of outlay, while <span class="kanji-inline">弗</span> serves as the phonetic indicator (marking the on-reading) and, in bronze inscriptions, also appears as a negation meaning “not.” With that negative overtone, the character originally suggests unrestrained spending—outlay that does not result in keeping anything—hence “waste.” The Shuowen describes it as making unbounded expenditures, and texts like the Lüshi Chunqiu use it in expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">費</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="神.html">神</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="傷.html">傷</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="魂.html">魂</a>, “to expend one’s spirit and wound the soul,” showing that its scope extends beyond money to the futile consumption of one’s energy and mind.</p>
