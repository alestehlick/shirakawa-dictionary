    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">薫</span> is a phono-semantic character whose older form is <span class="kanji-inline">薰</span>, composed of the grass radical and the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">熏</span>, read kun. Shirakawa explains that <span class="kanji-inline">熏</span> depicts a bag-like container (the shape written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="東.html">東</a>) set over a fire, in which things are heated so that smoke and aroma permeate them. From this scene come the senses of a sweet fragrance or fragrant herb, and also the act of fumigating or scenting. The idea of scent soaking in underlies compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">薰</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="染.html">染</a> (kunsen), where the body is thoroughly imbued with a strong aroma, and by metaphor extends to <span class="kanji-inline">薫</span><span class="kanji-inline">化</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">薫</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="陶.html">陶</a>, the gentle moral influence by which one’s virtue permeates and cultivates others.</p>
