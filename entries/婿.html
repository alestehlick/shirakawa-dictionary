    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a> element places the character in the realm of marriage and kinship, while <span class="kanji-inline">胥</span> functions as the phonetic, yielding the On reading sei. Classical sources treat <span class="kanji-inline">壻</span> as the orthodox form and gloss it as “husband,” and the Fangyan records that in the Eastern Qi region it was pronounced with the On of <span class="kanji-inline">倩</span> (sei), a graph meaning “to borrow/loan” that here serves as a sound reference. Related graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">甥</span> cluster around male kin, reinforcing the sense of an affinal male relation—hence “son-in-law.” In later usage, <span class="kanji-inline">婿</span> circulated as the popular (vulgar) form of <span class="kanji-inline">壻</span>.</p>
