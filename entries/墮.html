    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">墮</span> is a phono-semantic character built with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">隋</span> and the semantic <span class="kanji-inline">土</span>, the earth deity’s altar. In Shirakawa’s reading, <span class="kanji-inline">隋</span> itself depicts a ritual scene: <span class="kanji-inline">自</span> is the gods’ ladder for ascent and descent, <span class="kanji-inline">左</span> shows the hand grasping the curse-implement <span class="kanji-inline">工</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">月</span> is a slab of meat. Together they picture meat being set out before the gods’ ladder while the officiant, implement in hand, prays and seeks the gods’ presence. With the on reading da, <span class="kanji-inline">隋</span> comes to signify meat offered in worship. When this is placed at <span class="kanji-inline">土</span>, the altar of the earth deity, the offerings are piled up in heaps; from that image of things massing and giving way, <span class="kanji-inline">墮</span> takes on the sense of tumbling down and collapsing. The word later broadened to general notions of falling, crumbling, breaking, and tearing.</p>
