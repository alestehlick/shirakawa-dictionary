    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夫.html">夫</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">見</span>, but here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夫.html">夫</a> does not mean “husband.” In early forms it pictured a bunmawashi, a compass used to scribe circles, so <span class="kanji-inline">規</span> originally named the compass itself. Paired with <span class="kanji-inline">矩</span>, the carpenter’s square for straight lines and right angles, the two tools form <span class="kanji-inline">規</span><span class="kanji-inline">矩</span>, the instruments that set the rule, hence the senses of rule and regulation. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">肅</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">粛</span>) similarly shows a brush with the compass, evoking an outline drawn by compass and then completed with brushwork. From the practice of laying out a circle with a compass came extended senses such as judging, measuring, and planning. Later, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="定.html">定</a><span class="kanji-inline">規</span> came to denote the straightedge or square, while <span class="kanji-inline">規</span> was first the implement for circles.</p>
