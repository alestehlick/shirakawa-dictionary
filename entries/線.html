    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">線</span> is a phono-semantic character built with the silk radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a>, indicating thread, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="泉.html">泉</a> as its phonetic. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="泉.html">泉</a>, which originally depicts water welling up and falling from the base of a cliff, supplies the on reading sen. An older form wrote the character as <span class="kanji-inline">綫</span>, using <span class="kanji-inline">戔</span> as the phonetic, a graph that shows thin, flat layers piled up. Ancient dictionaries already define the word concretely: the Shuowen glosses it as “threads,” and the Yupian notes that it is “used to sew garments.” From the core sense of sewing thread or filament, the meaning broadened to any long, slender, continuous thing—hence “line” and “wire.” For the specific sense of sewing thread, older texts tend to write <span class="kanji-inline">線</span>, while later usage often favors the variant <span class="kanji-inline">綫</span>.</p>
