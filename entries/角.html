    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of an animal’s horn, clearly seen in the oracle-bone and bronze forms. It could denote pulling or handling an animal by its horn, in contrast to <span class="kanji-inline">牽</span>, which shows leading an ox with a rope, the element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="玄.html">玄</a> depicting the cord. From the projecting, pointed nature of a horn arose senses for a corner or angle, things with sharp edges, and by extension a square with four right angles; the image of animals locking horns also fostered meanings of contention and competition. The original form lives on in ritual bronzes of the Shang and Zhou periods, where a horn-shaped wine vessel was called <span class="kanji-inline">角</span>.</p>
