    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a phono-semantic graph. At its heart lies an older figure of prayer: a ritual in which a covenant vessel (sai) holding written appeals to the gods was set among the furrows of a field as one prayed for an abundant harvest. That primal image later appears with the altar sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a> to form <span class="kanji-inline">禱</span> “to pray.” <span class="kanji-inline">寿</span> blends a reduced element of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="老.html">老</a> “elder” with this prayer motif to express praying for a person’s long life; from that, it comes to mean longevity itself, life continuing for a long time, and by extension the words of felicitation offered on such occasions. Bronze inscriptions voice the wish succinctly in the formula <span class="kanji-inline">眉</span><span class="kanji-inline">壽</span><span class="kanji-inline">萬</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="年.html">年</a>, “May you enjoy longevity for ten thousand years.”</p>
