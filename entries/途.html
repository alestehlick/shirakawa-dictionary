    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character. In its original form <span class="kanji-inline">途</span>, the element <span class="kanji-inline">余</span> functions as the phonetic, signaling the On reading to; characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">荼</span> “to” (a bitter herb, nigana) and <span class="kanji-inline">涂</span> “to” (a ‘way’ at water) share this same phonetic. Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">余</span> as the image of a large, handled needle used in a ritual known as jodo, “way-piercing”: the needle is driven into the ground to purge malevolent forces hidden beneath the soil. <span class="kanji-inline">涂</span> depicts performing this rite at a watercourse, while <span class="kanji-inline">途</span> places it on a roadway. From this ritual of piercing and purification, both characters come to mean a road or way that has been exorcised and made safe.</p>
