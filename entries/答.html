    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa parses <span class="kanji-inline">答</span> as a phono-semantic graph with <span class="kanji-inline">合</span> as its phonetic core. In early usage, <span class="kanji-inline">合</span> itself bore the sense “to respond,” and bronze inscriptions even show it in phrases meaning “to respond to virtue.” The form of <span class="kanji-inline">合</span> depicts a lid set upon a ritual receptacle <span class="kanji-inline">口</span>—a covenant vessel that held written prayers—evoking the precise fitting of lid and container, and by extension the idea of a response that matches what is asked. This phonetic value of <span class="kanji-inline">合</span> is shared by characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">荅</span> (tō). Over time, <span class="kanji-inline">答</span> became the established character for answering in the context of a question.</p>
