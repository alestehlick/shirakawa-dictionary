    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">個</span> takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="固.html">固</a> as its phonetic, which marks the Sino-Japanese reading ko and suggests the idea of something firm and fixed in shape. From this grows the sense of a single, self-contained entity—one thing or one person—so the character comes to mean an individual and to serve as a general counter affixed to numerals (e.g., ikko ‘one piece’, niko ‘two pieces’). From the Tang period it is also used as a suffix in colloquial Chinese expressions, as in <span class="kanji-inline">真</span><span class="kanji-inline">個</span> (shinko, ‘really’) and <span class="kanji-inline">這</span><span class="kanji-inline">個</span> (shako, ‘this’).</p>
