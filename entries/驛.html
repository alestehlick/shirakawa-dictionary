    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">驛</span> is a phono-semantic character: the horse on the left signals the relay system of horse posts, while the right-hand component <span class="kanji-inline">睪</span> gives the sound eki and carries an image. In early forms, <span class="kanji-inline">睪</span> portrayed an animal’s body: the eyes above, and below—shaped like what later appears as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幸.html">幸</a>—the paws and feet. As that body is taken apart and loosened, the graph suggests something coming undone and extending onward. The related character <span class="kanji-inline">釋</span> combines the “claw” <span class="kanji-inline">釆</span> with the same figure to mean the dismembering of a carcass (whereas <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="解.html">解</a> depicts cutting off an ox’s horns); <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="釈.html">釈</a> is a later abbreviation using <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尺.html">尺</a> to mark the on-reading. From this sense of something stretched out in succession arose the idea of horse relays strung along a long road—the umaya—hence “post/relay station.” In modern Japanese the character is also written <span class="kanji-inline">駅</span> and denotes railway, bus, or metro stations.</p>
