    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">津</span> is a phono-semantic character formed with the water radical and the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span>. In early forms, <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span> depicts piercing the skin with a tattooing needle, with added marks indicating tattoo patterns on the chest and even a vessel set out to catch the blood—an image that highlights a blood-tinged liquid oozing from the wound. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">津</span> originally meant an oozing fluid mixed with blood, a sense still echoed in the term shin&#x27;eki (“bodily fluids”). In bronze inscriptions there also appears a different graph, combining <span class="kanji-inline">淮</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舟.html">舟</a>, connected with bird divination performed to assure the safety of travel by boat; that graph carried the meaning “ferry, port.” Because it shared the same sound, <span class="kanji-inline">津</span> was later borrowed to write “ferry” and “port” as well.</p>
