    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph, <span class="kanji-inline">接</span> sets the hand radical alongside the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">妾</span> (shō). In <span class="kanji-inline">妾</span>, the upper element was originally <span class="kanji-inline">辛</span>, the form of a large handled tattooing needle; oracle-bone inscriptions from the Yin period record <span class="kanji-inline">妾</span> as women offered to the river god—attendants dedicated to divine service. Because these maidservants served and came into intimate contact with the deity, the core sense of <span class="kanji-inline">接</span> was first “to make contact with the gods,” that is, to associate with or meet the divine, a nuance still felt in expressions for rites honoring the hearth deity. From this sacred contact the word broadened to human spheres: to meet and associate, then further to receiving and entertaining others, drawing near or being adjacent, attending, following after, and continuing.</p>
