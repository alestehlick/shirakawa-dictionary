    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">課</span> is a phono-semantic character: <span class="kanji-inline">言</span> (speech) provides the sphere of words and discourse, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="果.html">果</a> marks the on reading ka and contributes an image drawn from fruit—things gathered in one place yet internally divided into segments. Many graphs with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="果.html">果</a> as their phonetic (such as <span class="kanji-inline">夥</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">窠</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">顆</span>) share this sense of clustered units. Applied to language, <span class="kanji-inline">課</span> first suggested dividing text into discrete sections, and then the practice of allocating or imposing responsibility for each part. From this flow its familiar meanings: a section or lesson, an assignment or work to be done, and the act of assigning or trying a task.</p>
