    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">事</span> is a compound built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="史.html">史</a> with an added streamer. The graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="史.html">史</a> shows a hand raising a wooden staff to which a ritual container (sai) for covenant texts is attached, used in venerating ancestral spirits. From this, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="使.html">使</a> depicts that sacred apparatus fixed to a great branch and carried out among the provinces to worship mountains and rivers. With <span class="kanji-inline">事</span>, a streamer is affixed to the great branch to mark the holding of national rites, so the character first meant worship or festival. Phrases such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a><span class="kanji-inline">事</span> “great rite” and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="王.html">王</a><span class="kanji-inline">事</span> “the king’s rite” reflect this, and oracle-bone inscriptions often ask, “Shall the king’s rite be performed?” Receiving envoys from the Yin king and performing these rites signaled submission to royal authority. From this cultic base the meaning broadened to administration and affairs of state, then further to general affairs or things, and also the notion of serving under authority.</p>
