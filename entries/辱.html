    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">辱</span> is a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">辰</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a>. In early forms, <span class="kanji-inline">辰</span> depicts a mobile shell—like a clam—whose emptied shell was fixed to the end of a stick to make an implement; with the hand mark <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a>, the character shows that shell-tool held in the hand. From this image arose the original sense of cutting and eradicating weeds with a Venus-shell implement (shinki). This older meaning is preserved in <span class="kanji-inline">耨</span>, which combines the plough radical <span class="kanji-inline">耒</span> with <span class="kanji-inline">辱</span> to mean “to weed.” Later, the character came to express “to humiliate” and the feeling of shame, likely through association with a graph meaning “to feel ashamed.” From the notion of feeling abashed before someone worthy of reverence developed the polite sense katajikenai, an expression of humbled, grateful deference toward a superior.</p>
