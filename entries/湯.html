    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">湯</span> as a phono-semantic compound: the water element provides the field of meaning, while <span class="kanji-inline">易</span> serves as the phonetic. In his view, <span class="kanji-inline">易</span> depicts a piece of jade set upon a stand, its brilliance streaming downward—an image likened to the sun’s radiance. By extension, water warmed under such sunlike brilliance becomes “yu,” hot water, which is the core sense of <span class="kanji-inline">湯</span>. The same phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">易</span> marks the On-reading series seen in characters like <span class="kanji-inline">瑒</span> (a kind of jade) and <span class="kanji-inline">暢</span> (to grow long, unimpeded), reinforcing the sound value that yields tō. Culturally, the character evokes the ancient Japanese ordeal known as kukatachi (<span class="kanji-inline">盟</span><span class="kanji-inline">神</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="探.html">探</a><span class="kanji-inline">湯</span>), in which an accused person swore before the gods and immersed a hand in hot water—the innocent unharmed, the guilty scalded—while in China a tripod cooking vessel served in analogous rites. The character also lives on in Japanese linguistic lore: “yutoyomi” (<span class="kanji-inline">湯</span><span class="kanji-inline">桶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="読.html">読</a>み), literally “hot-water bucket reading,” names mixed readings where the first character takes kun and the second On, paired with its counterpart “jubakoyomi” (<span class="kanji-inline">重</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="箱.html">箱</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="読.html">読</a>み) for the reverse pattern.</p>
