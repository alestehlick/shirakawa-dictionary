    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>New is a compound graph built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辛.html">辛</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斤.html">斤</a>. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辛.html">辛</a> is a large, handled needle used for divination; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> is a tree; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斤.html">斤</a> is an axe. In the ancestral rite evoked here, a diviner casts the sacred needle to let the gods indicate a particular tree. That tree is then cut with an axe to make a mortuary tablet. Because this is a freshly felled, divinely chosen tree, the character came to mean “new” and “beginning.” The practice parallels the ritual of shooting a sacred arrow and building where it lands to mark the site of important constructions. Related characters preserve facets of the same scene: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="親.html">親</a> shows one bowing before the newly made mortuary tablet, hence “parent,” the newly revered person in the ancestral line; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="薪.html">薪</a> names the leftover wood used as firewood in the festival. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">新</span> remembers a sacred choosing, first cutting, and the sense of fresh inception.</p>
