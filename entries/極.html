    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">極</span> takes its sound from <span class="kanji-inline">亟</span>, which points to the on readings kyoku and goku. Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">亟</span> as formed from elements suggesting a narrow gap with a person forced in, a covenant vessel (sai) set in front bearing a curse text, and a hand pressing from behind—together depicting a method of shutting someone in for punishment. Pushed to its utmost, that punishment becomes <span class="kanji-inline">殛</span>, execution; <span class="kanji-inline">亟</span> is the original graph of <span class="kanji-inline">殛</span>. <span class="kanji-inline">極</span> names the site of such execution, a dead-end terminus, and from this idea of reaching the farthest point it came to mean to carry something to the limit (kiwameru), to reach an extreme (kiwamaru), the height or apex (kiwami), and by extension the ultimate or finest grade, as in gokujo.</p>
