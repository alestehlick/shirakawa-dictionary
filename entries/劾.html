    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">劾</span> as a phono-semantic graph with <span class="kanji-inline">亥</span> supplying the on-reading gai and the side element shaped like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a> reflecting the form of <span class="kanji-inline">耒</span>, a plow. He anchors its sense not in legal procedure but in ancient exorcistic rites: <span class="kanji-inline">亥</span> is the figure of an animal that, when blamed for a visiting tatari (a calamity or curse), was ritually beaten to dispel the misfortune—an act called oniyarai and written with graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">毅</span>. Related characters preserve the same ritual logic: <span class="kanji-inline">弾</span> is the twanging of a bowstring sounded to drive off malign forces around a dwelling, and the old form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="改.html">改</a> depicts beating a snake (<span class="kanji-inline">巳</span>) to purge a curse. Seen in this family, <span class="kanji-inline">劾</span> belongs to practices of beating and sounding to expel evil, a nuance echoed in <span class="kanji-inline">弾</span><span class="kanji-inline">劾</span>, which originally evoked driving out malice by bowstring and ritual blows and only later came to mean attacking or arraigning a person. Classical sources even describe “kaikai” as a potent talisman hung at the waist to ward off epidemics, emphasizing the word’s exorcistic core; in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">劾</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="罪.html">罪</a> it turns toward the investigation and exposure of wrongdoing.</p>
