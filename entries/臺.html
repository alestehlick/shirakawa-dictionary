    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original graph <span class="kanji-inline">臺</span> combines an abbreviated form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="高.html">高</a> “high” with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="至.html">至</a>, the sign of an arrow’s arrival. In ancient rites, a sacred arrow was shot to mark the auspicious spot for important construction, so <span class="kanji-inline">臺</span> names a lofty structure raised on such a divinely selected site—a vantage tower or utena. From this core sense it came to mean a stand or platform for setting things, and by extension a public office. Some old forms even depict a tree set upon the rooftop, like a landmark tree, signaling a stately, sacred mansion where the gods approach. Famous examples include the Deer Terrace (<span class="kanji-inline">鹿</span><span class="kanji-inline">台</span>) of the last Shang king and the Zhanghua Terrace (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="章.html">章</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="華.html">華</a><span class="kanji-inline">台</span>) of Chu, celebrated as magnificent elevated mansions. The widely used simplified graph <span class="kanji-inline">台</span> was originally a different character and did not itself denote a building.</p>
