    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">働</span> as a phono-semantic character: the person radical on the left marks a human agent, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="動.html">動</a> on the right supplies the sound and evokes the idea of exertion. He traces <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="動.html">動</a> back to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a>, the force of the plow, and to an original sense of setting to work in the fields, which broadened to activity and exertion. <span class="kanji-inline">働</span> itself was coined in Japan and, especially from the Meiji period, served to render Western concepts of “work” in compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="稼.html">稼</a><span class="kanji-inline">働</span> (operation) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="労.html">労</a><span class="kanji-inline">働</span> (labor), later circulating in China for a time. Altogether, the graph depicts a person engaged in purposeful activity—working.</p>
