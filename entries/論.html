    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">論</span> is a phono-semantic character formed with the speech element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> and the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">侖</span>. The phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">侖</span>, which also appears in <span class="kanji-inline">崙</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">掄</span>, originally means things laid or piled in orderly sequence, and here it supplies both sound and the notion of arrangement. The character thus evokes words set out in order. In the Shuowen it is glossed as ‘to consult, deliberate,’ the process of stating one’s views and contending toward agreement. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">論</span> comes to mean to argue and discuss, to inquire into a matter, and to set forth or explain.</p>
