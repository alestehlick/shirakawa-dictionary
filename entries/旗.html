    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the “streamer” element depicts a pennant attached to a flagpole, while <span class="kanji-inline">其</span> supplies the sound ki and originally pictured a square winnowing basket (<span class="kanji-inline">箕</span>), carrying the idea of something square—just as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="棋.html">棋</a>, a square game board. The flag in early usage was a nearly square military standard. Ancient practice prescribed specific signals—raising a blue-green flag to indicate a river ahead, or a tiger hide when enemy forces were sighted—and armies were directed by such flags, so <span class="kanji-inline">旗</span><span class="kanji-inline">下</span> came to mean troops under the general’s banner, the main battle line. In later times flags served as shop signs, giving rise to terms like <span class="kanji-inline">旗</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="亭.html">亭</a> (restaurant/inn) and <span class="kanji-inline">酒</span><span class="kanji-inline">旗</span> (tavern sign). A related banner, <span class="kanji-inline">旌</span>, was used to adorn and honor, hence <span class="kanji-inline">旌</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="表.html">表</a> “to commend.”</p>
