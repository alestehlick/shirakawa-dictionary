    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">抑</span> as a compound graph that sets the hand <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="手.html">手</a> against <span class="kanji-inline">卬</span>, a figure of two people facing one another. When those facing figures are arranged vertically, the scene becomes one person lying face up while another holds them down. Viewed from below this relation yields <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="仰.html">仰</a>, “to look up,” but seen from above it becomes <span class="kanji-inline">抑</span>, with the hand pressing down. The character thus expresses the act of stopping or suppressing by pushing and holding something down.</p>
