    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character: the water element signals matters of fluid and the throat, while the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">曷</span> (katsu) supplies the sound and imagery. In Shirakawa’s reading, <span class="kanji-inline">曷</span> combines the form of bones of the dead (<span class="kanji-inline">勾</span>) with a sacred receptacle containing a written prayer (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>), evoking an intense ritual of supplication in which the bones act as a spirit of malediction. From the scene of crying out in fervent prayer until the throat goes dry, the meaning of thirst and running dry arose; by extension, the graph also came to express craving or devouring, overlapping with the sense later written with <span class="kanji-inline">愒</span>. The older form is <span class="kanji-inline">渴</span>.</p>
