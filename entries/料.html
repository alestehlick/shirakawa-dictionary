    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Formed from the graphs for rice (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="米.html">米</a>) and the ladle-measure <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斗.html">斗</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">料</span> pictures grain being measured out with a handled scoop. In early lexicography it is defined straightforwardly as “to measure,” specifically the measuring of quantity. From that concrete scene the sense broadened to measuring or comparing in general, and then to what is measured out for use: materials for making things, and by extension provisions and food, as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">材</span><span class="kanji-inline">料</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">飼</span><span class="kanji-inline">料</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">食</span><span class="kanji-inline">料</span>.</p>
