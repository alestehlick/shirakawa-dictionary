    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">講</span> is a phono-semantic character built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, “speech,” and <span class="kanji-inline">冓</span> (kou) as the phonetic. <span class="kanji-inline">冓</span> originally depicts strings of identical ornaments tied together above and below, conveying the idea of assembling or putting things together. That image carries into compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="構.html">構</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="築.html">築</a>, where timber is put together to build. In <span class="kanji-inline">講</span>, the notion is applied to words: gathering and arranging speech to expound, explain, consider, devise plans, and teach—hence its senses of lecture, explanation, planning, and instruction.</p>
