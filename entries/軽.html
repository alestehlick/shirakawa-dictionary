    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">輕</span>, this is a phono-semantic compound: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="車.html">車</a> “vehicle” plus the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">巠</span>, which also guides the on reading kei. In ancient form, <span class="kanji-inline">巠</span> depicts the warp on a loom spread out and pulled taut by a transverse bar—straight, tightly drawn threads. From that image of directness and tension arose nuances of lightness and quickness. Applied to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="車.html">車</a>, it described a cart that moved lightly and swiftly; the sense then generalized to “light” and “fast” more broadly. From “light” further grew the shades “handy, easy, readily done,” and, in judgments of conduct or taste, “vulgar, shabby.”</p>
