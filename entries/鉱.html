    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character. Its older form was <span class="kanji-inline">鑛</span>, with the metal radical indicating the field of metals and minerals, while <span class="kanji-inline">廣</span> functions as the phonetic that gives the on reading ko and originally depicted a spacious hall. The Shuowen records the variant <span class="kanji-inline">礦</span> with the stone radical, and the component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="黄.html">黄</a> evokes the yellowish hue characteristic of raw ore. Although no oracle-bone or bronze forms are known, the pattern seen in <span class="kanji-inline">磺</span>—stone combined with yellow—likely preserves the earliest idea: aragane, unprocessed ore and mineral stone. Places where such ore-bearing stones were gathered were treated as sacred precincts, tightly bound by taboo and guarded through ritual imprecation.</p>
