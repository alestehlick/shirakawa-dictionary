    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">机</span> as a phono-semantic character: <span class="kanji-inline">几</span> serves as the phonetic, indicating the on reading ki, while the original form depicts a small stand with legs at both ends—first a stool or chair, and by extension an armrest. This same support is seen in <span class="kanji-inline">凭</span>, ‘to lean on,’ where the body rests against an armrest. From such a portable stand the meaning broadened to a desk for reading and writing. Hence expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">机</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="案.html">案</a>, literally ‘desk and consideration,’ with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="案.html">案</a> naming both a desk and the act of thinking, and the epistolary honorific <span class="kanji-inline">机</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="下.html">下</a>, ‘at your desk,’ used beside an addressee’s name.</p>
