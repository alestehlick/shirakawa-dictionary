    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character: the element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="占.html">占</a> serves as the phonetic, as seen in the related character <span class="kanji-inline">拈</span> (“to pinch”), and the original form was written <span class="kanji-inline">黏</span>, which set <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="占.html">占</a> beside <span class="kanji-inline">黍</span>, “millet.” The choice of millet is telling—its grain is naturally glutinous—so the graph came to express the quality of tackiness and the action of sticking or pasting. As the Shuowen explains, it denotes things adhering to one another. Over time, the character is used for the sensations and acts of sticking, clinging, and glutinousness.</p>
