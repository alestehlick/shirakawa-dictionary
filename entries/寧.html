    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its oldest form, <span class="kanji-inline">寧</span> shows a rite performed beneath the roof of an ancestral hall: on a raised stand rests a dish upon which the heart of a sacrificial animal is set, the heart itself graphically included to make the offering explicit. Some ancient forms even omit the stand and approach the shape of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="盛.html">盛</a>, reflecting the shared image of a piled offering. This scene embodies the act of prayer for public peace and quiet; hence early sources gloss it as words of supplication and as silence and calm. Oracle-bone divinations ask, “Will the king be calm this evening?” using <span class="kanji-inline">寧</span> for the state of composed tranquility. From this ritual context the character comes to mean peace, quietness, and gentle calm, and by extension careful attentiveness and politeness, as in the word teinei.</p>
