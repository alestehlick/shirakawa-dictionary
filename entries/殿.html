    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">殿</span> is formed from <span class="kanji-inline">屍</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>. In early script, <span class="kanji-inline">屍</span> shows a person seated on a stand like <span class="kanji-inline">丌</span>, emphasizing the hips and buttocks, and it is the original graph for <span class="kanji-inline">臀</span>, the buttocks. <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span> depicts a hand wielding a long cudgel or pike. Brought together, the character reflects the custom of striking the buttocks as a form of chastisement. In later usage it came to denote the grand residence or hall associated with authority—palaces and noble mansions—and by extension it became a respectful title for the person who dwells there, as in the Japanese honorific readings tono and dono.</p>
