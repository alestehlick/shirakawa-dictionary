    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">期</span> is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">其</span> as its phonetic. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">其</span> originally depicts a square dustpan (<span class="kanji-inline">箕</span>), and from its sense of something regular and of set dimensions comes the idea of a defined span. In early forms <span class="kanji-inline">期</span> appears with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a>, and some variants add another sign, tying the meaning to calendrical cycles—the month or day marked by the movements of the moon and sun. Accordingly, <span class="kanji-inline">期</span> denotes a specific, fixed stretch of time and, by extension, an appointed date (as in terms like <span class="kanji-inline">期</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a> or <span class="kanji-inline">納</span><span class="kanji-inline">期</span>), and it can also express the idea of meeting or coming together at a set time.</p>
