    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa views <span class="kanji-inline">音</span> as a compound built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, combining the form of a tattooing needle set above a ritual covenant vessel (sai) into which oath-texts were placed when one swore before the gods, accepting tattooing as the penalty for deceit. It first evoked solemn words addressed to the deities. In the deep quiet of night, when the gods answered, a faint resonance was believed to arise from within that vessel; the short vertical stroke inside marks this inner echo, and so the graph came to mean “sound.” <span class="kanji-inline">音</span> is thus the otonai, the visiting sound of the gods—their will revealed by a subtle auditory sign. This nocturnal, scarcely audible quality is mirrored in related graphs: <span class="kanji-inline">闇</span> conjures the gods’ sound welling up from the vessel set before the double doors (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a>) of the household altar, hence “darkness,” and <span class="kanji-inline">瘖</span> expresses the blurring or hindrance of speech. Beyond “sound,” the character extends to musical tones, news or report of a person, and the nuance of tone or timbre.</p>
