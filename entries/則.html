    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">則</span> as a compound that sets a knife beside the ritual tripod <span class="kanji-inline">鼎</span>, picturing the act of cutting or incising text into a bronze vessel. In ancient practice, solemn covenants were engraved on tripods and preserved; thus <span class="kanji-inline">鼎</span> can denote a treaty carved on a round tripod, <span class="kanji-inline">劑</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">剤</span>) an inscription on a square tripod, and <span class="kanji-inline">質</span> an inscription on a tripod marked with two axes. Because a covenant fixed in bronze was to be observed without alteration, <span class="kanji-inline">則</span> came to mean a rule, regulation, model, or standard, and by extension “to act in accordance with, to conform.” In classical usage it also serves with the sense “namely.”</p>
