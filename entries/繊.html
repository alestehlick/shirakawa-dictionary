    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">纖</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the thread radical sets the scene of spinning and weaving, while the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">籤</span> supplies the reading sen and an image of extreme fineness. In <span class="kanji-inline">籤</span>, Shirakawa sees a pike taking off two heads in succession, a severe motif that underlies the sense found in <span class="kanji-inline">殲</span> “to annihilate.” With the addition of the leek sign <span class="kanji-inline">韭</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">籤</span> comes to suggest cutting or mincing something into very small pieces. Placed under the thread radical, that nuance yields <span class="kanji-inline">纖</span>: an exceedingly slender strand, and by extension the ideas “fine,” “thin,” and “minute.” Later, <span class="kanji-inline">籤</span> also named the slim bamboo slips used for drawing lots, reinforcing the association with small, delicate pieces.</p>
