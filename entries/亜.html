    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally a pictograph of the plan of an underground tomb chamber: a regular square with its four corners pared away, thought to prevent malevolent spirits from hiding there. <span class="kanji-inline">亜</span> (ancient form <span class="kanji-inline">亞</span>) came to denote the official responsible for burials and rites for the dead; powerful clans appointed such a person to oversee the tomb chamber and used emblems shaped like <span class="kanji-inline">亞</span>, often incorporating the clan name, as a kind of family mark. Because this tomb-keeper bore sacred clerical duties, he stood second to the clan chief, which gave the character its sense of “next” or “second.” The related graph <span class="kanji-inline">堊</span> (“white earth”) refers to the kaolin with which the walls and ceilings of such chambers were originally painted.</p>
