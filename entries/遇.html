    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">遇</span> takes its sound from <span class="kanji-inline">禺</span>, which Shirakawa interprets as the figure of a crouching, watchful animal with an oversized head—a form reminiscent of the clay or wooden effigies that stood in for deities or notable persons (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="偶.html">偶</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="人.html">人</a>). Meeting such an uncanny stand-in would be an extraordinary event, and so the character came to mean an unexpected encounter, as seen in expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">遇</span><span class="kanji-inline">然</span> “by chance.” Because such encounters demand care and respect, the sense broadened to treatment or handling, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="優.html">優</a><span class="kanji-inline">遇</span> “to treat favorably.” Here, <span class="kanji-inline">禺</span> serves as the phonetic core (giving the on reading guu) while guiding the character’s development from “to meet” to “to treat.”</p>
