    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph of a kneeling woman with her hands placed one over the other in front of her in a posture of reverent worship. Oracle-bone forms even show a variant with a small dot, indicating purification by libation, which clarifies that the figure depicts a woman serving the spirit of the dead. The image thus expresses a ritual stance, not submission before a man. In related compositions such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="安.html">安</a>, the woman appears within a mausoleum, and a short extra stroke marks a fringed cloth used to guide the soul’s transfer. Beyond its basic sense of “woman, female,” the graph was also used as a second-person pronoun—later written with <span class="kanji-inline">汝</span>—and seems originally to have been a form of address for women or girls.</p>
