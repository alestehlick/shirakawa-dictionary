    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its original form <span class="kanji-inline">識</span> combines the speech element with a right-hand component depicting a halberd adorned with an attached emblem—a decorated weapon used as a standard or marker. That ornament was likely red silk, a nuance that links this component to related graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">熾</span>, evoking blazing brilliance, and <span class="kanji-inline">幟</span>, a banner fixed to a pole. The right element thus both provides the sound and conjures the idea of a conspicuous sign. From the notion that one can distinguish and identify things by such a mark, the character’s meaning extends from “sign; to mark” to “to know, to recognize,” and by further development to “knowledge” (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="知.html">知</a><span class="kanji-inline">識</span>) and “discernment, sound judgment” (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="見.html">見</a><span class="kanji-inline">識</span>).</p>
