    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">宅</span> as a picto-phonetic character: beneath the protective roof <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span> stands <span class="kanji-inline">乇</span>, the phonetic that gives the on reading taku. But <span class="kanji-inline">乇</span> is more than a sound; it was traditionally described as a sprouting leaf, a sign tied to divinatory practice, and in related characters like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="託.html">託</a> it points to receiving a divine charge. Within this view, the lower element in <span class="kanji-inline">宅</span> evokes a sacred structure—specifically the mausoleum where ancestors are venerated—serving as the site for consulting the gods. Oracle-bone inscriptions even record inquiries made “in the new mausoleum,” showing it as a place for seeking and receiving revelatory messages. Accordingly, <span class="kanji-inline">宅</span> first meant a place permeated by the divine will, a locus of sacred presence. Only later did its sense broaden to the human sphere: the place where one is and lives—the dwelling, house, or residence.</p>
