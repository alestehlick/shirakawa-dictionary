    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a straightforward pictograph: a sheep seen from the front, capturing the upper body and its paired horns. By contrast, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="美.html">美</a> depicts the entire animal as if viewed from above, from the horns down to the hind legs, while <span class="kanji-inline">牛</span> shows an ox front-on, its horns drawn more massively than a sheep’s. In ancient ritual, sheep were important offerings to the gods and were also used in a sacred sheep ordeal. From this context, <span class="kanji-inline">義</span> expresses the careful inspection that ensured a sacrificial sheep was without blemish, and <span class="kanji-inline">犠</span> originally referred to the ox presented in sacrifice.</p>
