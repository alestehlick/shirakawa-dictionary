    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a straightforward pictograph: a sheep seen from the front, capturing the upper body and its paired horns. By contrast, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="美.html">美</a> depicts the entire animal as if viewed from above, from the horns down to the hind legs, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="牛.html">牛</a> shows an ox front-on, its horns drawn more massively than a sheep’s. In ancient ritual, sheep were important offerings to the gods and were also used in a sacred sheep ordeal. From this context, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="義.html">義</a> expresses the careful inspection that ensured a sacrificial sheep was without blemish, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犠.html">犠</a> originally referred to the ox presented in sacrifice.</p>
