    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">誠</span> as a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, the words of an oath, combined with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="成.html">成</a>, which provides the on reading sei and depicts a ritual act in which a pike (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>) is adorned and used to exorcise, signifying completion and purification. In this light, <span class="kanji-inline">誠</span> expresses words pledged to the deities from a heart purified by such rites—and by extension, that purified heart at the moment of swearing. Hence its senses of sincerity, making something sincere, and true heart. Classical texts honor this quality: the Zhongyong declares, “Sincerity is the Way of Heaven,” and Mencius repeatedly upheld <span class="kanji-inline">誠</span> as a central virtue.</p>
