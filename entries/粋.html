    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">粹</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="米.html">米</a> “rice” supplies the sense, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="卒.html">卒</a> serves as the phonetic, pointing to the reading sui—the same value heard in graphs like <span class="kanji-inline">悴</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">萃</span>. The Shuowen glosses it as “not in disarray,” conjuring the image of rice that has been polished and kept free of admixture: unmingled, genuine grain. In deliberate contrast to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="雑.html">雑</a>, the character for gathering and mixing many colors, <span class="kanji-inline">粋</span> came to mean the pure and the unadulterated. In Japanese it further developed the nuance of iki—chic, a crisp, polished stylishness set against boorishness.</p>
