    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a fine-toothed comb, its teeth aligned to left and right; in antiquity it was called hiyo (written <span class="kanji-inline">非</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a>). Its later use to mean “not” (arazu) is a phonetic loan based on its sound. From the sense of denial it came to mark what runs counter to accepted norms and institutions, as seen in compounds like hido (injustice), hiho (illegality), and hirei (discourtesy), and by extension it conveys “to be contrary to,” “to oppose,” or “to be off target.” The graph <span class="kanji-inline">匪</span> was also used at times in place of <span class="kanji-inline">非</span> to write this negative sense.</p>
