    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of an animal that bends its tail and crouches. The graph centers on <span class="kanji-inline">尸</span>, depicting the upper half of the animal’s body; in older forms a long, furry tail is clearly drawn below. The element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="出.html">出</a> represents the footprint form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a> with a curved stroke indicating the heel. Together they show a creature lowering itself with its tail tucked, hence the senses “stoop, crouch” and, by extension, “bend.” Because a tucked tail signals willing submission and obedience, the character also came to mean “yield” or “submit.” This image lives on in words such as <span class="kanji-inline">窟</span>, “cave,” conceived as the dwelling of such an animal, and in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="窮.html">窮</a><span class="kanji-inline">屈</span>, “cramped,” evoking the confined posture of life in a rock cave.</p>
