    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa analyzes <span class="kanji-inline">履</span> as a composite showing ritual footwear and movement. The graph brings together <span class="kanji-inline">尸</span>, a katashiro—an effigy standing in for an ancestral spirit at rites—alongside <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, the “go, walk” element from the crossroads graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a>, and <span class="kanji-inline">夊</span>, the form of feet in motion. The component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舟.html">舟</a> here does not mean “boat” but depicts the scooped, hollowed shape of ceremonial footwear. From this image of putting on shoes for formal occasions such as funerals and then setting out, the character came to mean to don footwear and, by extension, to proceed to carry out what has been declared—hence its use in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">履</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a>, “to fulfill, to execute.”</p>
