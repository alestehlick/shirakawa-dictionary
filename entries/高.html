    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">高</span> as a compound built from an abbreviated form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="京.html">京</a> and an enclosing element used here as sai, a sacred receptacle for covenantal prayer slips. In archaic depiction, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="京.html">京</a> shows the arched entrance and exit of the capital’s great fortress gate, surmounted by a watchtower. The whole graph pictures presenting written prayers at that imposing gate to purify the threshold and keep malign forces from entering. Because the gate is crowned by a high lookout, the character naturally came to mean high, tall, and great, and by extension a high place or rank and, in a spiritual sense, refined nobility—sensed in contrasts like <span class="kanji-inline">高</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="低.html">低</a> and in words such as <span class="kanji-inline">高</span><span class="kanji-inline">尚</span>.</p>
