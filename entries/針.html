    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains that the earliest form of this word was written <span class="kanji-inline">鍼</span>, with <span class="kanji-inline">咸</span> as the phonetic element that gives the on reading shin; the same phonetic appears in <span class="kanji-inline">箴</span>. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">針</span> later developed as the simpler form. In ancient writing the figure shows a needle as a straight stroke with a prominent dot marking the tiny hole—the eye—through which thread passes, a depiction that eventually settled into the standardized character. The Shuowen glosses it as a sewing implement, hence the core sense “sewing needle.” A curved implement is written <span class="kanji-inline">鉤</span> for a fishhook, reserving <span class="kanji-inline">鍼</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">箴</span> for medical needles; from that medical context these graphs also came to be used figuratively for “to admonish” and “admonition.”</p>
