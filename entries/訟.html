    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">訟</span> as a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> provides the sphere of speech and dispute, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="公.html">公</a> serves as the sound element and depicts the squared ceremonial court—an enclosed precinct where ancestral rites were performed and judicial hearings were held. Rooted in that ritual-judicial setting, the character took on senses such as bringing a suit, adjudicating, and reproaching. Bronze inscriptions already show it in legal collocations like <span class="kanji-inline">訊</span><span class="kanji-inline">訟</span> (interrogation and litigation) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="罰.html">罰</a><span class="kanji-inline">訟</span> (penalty and litigation). The same <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="公.html">公</a> element marks the on-reading in related characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">頌</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="松.html">松</a>; in <span class="kanji-inline">頌</span> it evokes the courtly space of song and dance used to praise ancestral virtue, reflected in terms like <span class="kanji-inline">頌</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="歌.html">歌</a>, songs of praise.</p>
