    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, this character is a pictograph of childbirth: the thighs spread as a child emerges. From that vivid image it bore the sense umu, “to give birth,” and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="免.html">免</a> originally wrote what is now distinguished as <span class="kanji-inline">娩</span> (ben, “to give birth”). Because two similar-looking graphs were taken to be the same, they eventually merged into the single character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="免.html">免</a>.</p>
