    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the bird element signifies a bird, while <span class="kanji-inline">此</span> provides the on-reading shi and evokes the sense of something fine or small—akin to <span class="kanji-inline">些</span> in “sashō,” a little. Extending the idea of smallness to birds yields the meaning “female,” reflecting the observation that female birds are generally smaller than males. From this base grew broader associations: distinctions of male and female map onto ideas of strength and weakness and the protective noncombatant stance praised in Laozi. The original image of the female bird yielding to the male also underlies the word shifuku, “to lie low,” which expresses enduring under another’s rule while waiting for the right moment to act.</p>
