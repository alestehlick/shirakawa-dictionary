    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">難</span> as a compound whose bronze-script form depicts a short-tailed bird (zui/‘tori’) being shot with a fire-tipped arrow. This striking image conveys the idea of startling and harrying a bird—hence the senses of afflicting, plaguing, and being troubled. He connects the scene to the exorcistic rite <span class="kanji-inline">儺</span> (oni-yarai), where bird-related divination played a role in averting misfortune. From this core of ‘to distress’ the character broadened to mean calamity and, by extension, difficulty or hardness.</p>
