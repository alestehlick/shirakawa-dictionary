    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">滑</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water element signals wetness, while <span class="kanji-inline">骨</span> functions as the phonetic that gives the on-readings katsu and kotsu—its role as a sound marker is also seen in <span class="kanji-inline">猾</span> “wily.” The smooth, polished surface of bone reinforces the idea of sleekness, so with water it evokes getting wet and becoming slippery or smooth. The compound <span class="kanji-inline">滑</span><span class="kanji-inline">稽</span> was originally the name of a wine vessel famed for seeming never to run dry, an image that led to the sense of speech flowing freely and without hesitation, and from there to joking and witticism.</p>
