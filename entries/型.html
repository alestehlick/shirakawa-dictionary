    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">型</span> as a phono‑semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刑.html">刑</a> serves as the on‑reading indicator, while the graphic parts sketch the craft of metal casting. The grid‑like <span class="kanji-inline">井</span> shows the outer frame of a casting mold; this frame is plastered with earth (written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> in most forms) to make the actual form, and the side knife <span class="kanji-inline">刂</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a>) is the tool used to trim and finish the mold’s surfaces. In older script, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a> often appears where <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> later stands, picturing the pot or crucible from which molten bronze is poured into the mold. From this concrete sense of igata, a casting mold, the character broadened to the general idea of kata, a form or pattern. Shirakawa also notes the related image behind <span class="kanji-inline">剛</span> “solid,” which evokes tearing off the mold—baked hard by intense heat—with a knife after casting, further anchoring <span class="kanji-inline">型</span> in the foundry scene.</p>
