    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">育</span> as an image rooted in childbirth and care. The graph joins the inverted figure of a newborn—the ‘totsu’ shape of a child descending at birth—with the nikuzuki “flesh” element to mark a human body. He treats <span class="kanji-inline">毓</span> as the original form: it shows the mother, written <span class="kanji-inline">每</span>, with the child’s head, hair first, added behind her as it emerges. Both <span class="kanji-inline">育</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">毓</span> thus depict a child being born, from which the meanings expand to giving life and then rearing and nourishing a child—hence the senses of raising, bringing up, and educating.</p>
