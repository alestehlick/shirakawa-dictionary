    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>, the right hand, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a>, the form of flesh or sacrificial meat. It originally portrays taking the offering meat in one’s hand and presenting it to the gods, hence the earliest sense of making an offering. From that concrete act of holding and presenting came the generalized meanings “to hold,” “to keep,” and ultimately “to have” and “to exist.” It is the original graph of <span class="kanji-inline">侑</span>, associated with urging or presenting food. In oracle-bone inscriptions the hand element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a> is often used alone to write the sense “to have,” while in bronze inscriptions both <span class="kanji-inline">有</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">在</span> appear in contexts of possession and existence.</p>
