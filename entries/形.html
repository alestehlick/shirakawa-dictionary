    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In early writing, <span class="kanji-inline">形</span> is composed of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="井.html">井</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">彡</span>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="井.html">井</a> does not depict a well but the wooden outer frame of a casting mold—the waku into which molten metal was poured—while <span class="kanji-inline">彡</span> is a sign that evokes beauty in color and outline. Together they first named the handsome, well-proportioned form of objects cast in such molds, and by extension came to denote the shape of things in general and even the figure of a person.</p>
