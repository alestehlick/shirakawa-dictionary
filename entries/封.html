    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The old form of <span class="kanji-inline">封</span> combines three elements: <span class="kanji-inline">丰</span>, the figure of a young tree; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a>, the earth that is also the basis of the shrine (the original form of <span class="kanji-inline">社</span>); and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>, a hand. Together they depict planting a tree by hand at a sacred site, a rite for inviting a deity’s presence. From this solemn act evolved the political sense of enfeoffment—distributing the Son of Heaven’s land and appointing lords (<span class="kanji-inline">封</span><span class="kanji-inline">建</span>). Related expressions preserve the ritual background: <span class="kanji-inline">封</span><span class="kanji-inline">樹</span> is the heaping of earth on a grave and planting a tree, and <span class="kanji-inline">封</span><span class="kanji-inline">禅</span> is the ceremony in which the Son of Heaven raises altars and offers worship to heaven and earth. In later usage, with the on reading fuu, the character means to shut or seal, as in <span class="kanji-inline">封</span><span class="kanji-inline">鎖</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">封</span><span class="kanji-inline">書</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">封</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="筒.html">筒</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="密.html">密</a><span class="kanji-inline">封</span>.</p>
