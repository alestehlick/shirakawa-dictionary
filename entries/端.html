    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">端</span> as a phono-semantic graph whose phonetic element supplies the on‑reading tan. In early forms the character brings together the image of a shaman—hair let loose for ritual—set at a designated position, indicated by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="立.html">立</a>, so the whole depicts a shaman seated in formally correct posture. From this arise senses such as “to sit properly,” “proper,” and “to set right.” Archaeological arrangements, notably the layout of ritual vessels in the Shang tomb of Lady Fu Hao, place the shaman at the upper-left extremity of the ceremonial space; from that fixed station the character naturally took on the meanings “end,” “edge,” and “side,” and because counting began from that corner, it further came to mean “start” or “beginning.” In Japanese it also yields the sense “odd” in compounds like hasu (fractional remainder) and hanpa (incomplete, neither one thing nor the other).</p>
