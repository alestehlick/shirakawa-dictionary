    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the movement radical <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> provides the idea of going, while the right-hand element acts as the phonetic, giving the on-reading ken and depicting a sacred meat offering borne in both hands. In early military ritual, troops departing for the front held a victory rite at the army shrine and set out carrying a large piece of consecrated meat into which their guardian spirit was believed to have been transferred. A sacred post was erected before this offering when the force marched or encamped, and when the army divided, the meat was ritually cut and apportioned by the commander. Against this ritual background, <span class="kanji-inline">遣</span> first meant to send out or dispatch an army. The sense later broadened to sending in general, and further extended to presenting something or even casting it away. In Japanese it also developed the everyday sense “to use, spend,” as heard in expressions like ki o tsukau, kane o tsukau, and kozukai.</p>
