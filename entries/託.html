    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the speech element <span class="kanji-inline">言</span> supplies the sphere of speaking and petitioning, while the right-side <span class="kanji-inline">乇</span>, read taku, provides the sound. In form, <span class="kanji-inline">乇</span> depicts a plant leaf stretching forward with its tip, and it evokes a practice of divination using leaves—seeking the gods’ intent and receiving a divine oracle (shintaku). From the act of asking after the divine will came senses such as to ask or rely on another, to entrust something to someone, and, by extension, to use something as a pretext. The graph is also used in place of the simpler <span class="kanji-inline">托</span> for meanings like “to receive” and “to ask.”</p>
