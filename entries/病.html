    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: <span class="kanji-inline">疒</span> marks the domain of illness, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丙.html">丙</a> serves as the phonetic, giving the sound (hei/byo). In the Shuowen it is explained as a <span class="kanji-inline">疾</span> that has grown—an ailment that advances or becomes established—hence a serious or worsening sickness. This sense is seen in the Analects (Zi Han IX:12), where <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a><span class="kanji-inline">疾</span><span class="kanji-inline">病</span> refers to Confucius being gravely ill. From this core, the character came to mean ‘illness’ and ‘to fall ill,’ and by extension also expresses being worn out with fatigue or weighed down with grief.</p>
