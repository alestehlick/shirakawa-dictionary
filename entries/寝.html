    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads this as a compound graph whose archaic form shows a roof, <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span>, sheltering a broom, <span class="kanji-inline">帚</span>. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, the roof marks the ancestral shrine or mausoleum, while the broom evokes the ritual sweeping and sprinkling of fragrant liquor used to exorcise and purify that sacred space; from this rite the graph first bore the sense mitamaya, “mausoleum.” Later, by adding the bedstead element <span class="kanji-inline">爿</span> to <span class="kanji-inline">箒</span>, the form <span class="kanji-inline">寢</span> arose to write the act of sleeping, and that later form was also used in place of <span class="kanji-inline">寝</span> for the earlier “mausoleum” sense. Thus the character gathers the image of the shrine under its roof and, in its later development, the notion of lying down to sleep; <span class="kanji-inline">寢</span> itself is a later creation, not recorded in the Shuowen.</p>
