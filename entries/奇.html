    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">奇</span> as a ritual compound: one element is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>, understood not as a mouth but as the sacred receptacle (sai) that holds written petitions to the gods; the other depicts a large, curved knife with a handle. In the oracle and bronze forms the character portrays urging or pressing the deities with this imposing knife so that the prayers placed in the receptacle will be brought to fruition, a structure comparable to that of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="可.html">可</a>. Because such knife‑bearing supplication lies outside ordinary practice, the graph came to mean what departs from the usual—strange, different—and by extension what stands out by surpassing the norm, hence “exceptional.”</p>
