    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the upper <span class="kanji-inline">艹</span> indicates plants and supplies the meaning, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="早.html">早</a> functions as the phonetic, giving the on reading sou; in early graphs <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="早.html">早</a> depicts the bowl of a ladle. The character continues the older form <span class="kanji-inline">艸</span> and fundamentally means grass or herbage, as in words for grassy plains and mountain plants. By extension it describes what is rough or unrefined (shabby, rustic) and, in writing, a rough copy or draft. It is also used by loan with the sense of beginning, seen in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">草</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="創.html">創</a> (inauguration, first founding) and <span class="kanji-inline">起</span><span class="kanji-inline">草</span> (to draft, begin writing).</p>
