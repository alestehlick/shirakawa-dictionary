    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">義</span> as a compound of sheep (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羊.html">羊</a>) and the sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="我.html">我</a>, which originally depicts a saw. In ancient rites, sheep—favored as offerings—were cut in half with a saw so that the sacrifice could be shown flawless inside and out: not only the fleece, horns, and hooves, but even the inner organs free of any defect. From this ideal of a sacrifice wholly fit before the gods, <span class="kanji-inline">義</span> first meant what is correct as an offering and later broadened to what is right and proper in general. The right side of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犠.html">犠</a> in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犠.html">犠</a><span class="kanji-inline">牲</span> preserves this image as <span class="kanji-inline">羲</span>, showing the lower legs of the sawn sacrificial sheep hanging down; with the cattle element added, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犠.html">犠</a> extends the notion to sacrifices including oxen and other animals.</p>
