    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally a pictograph of a tall building with an arched gateway, sometimes drawn with a lookout set on the roof, <span class="kanji-inline">亭</span> named a structure that combined lodging with a watch post. In the Han period, such <span class="kanji-inline">亭</span> were installed at fixed intervals of ten li as official waystations, which is why the character came to mean a posting or relay station, an inn, or a watchtower. In later usage it also referred to the simple roofed garden pavilion or arbor where people rest and take in the view.</p>
