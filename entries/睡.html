    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character in which <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="垂.html">垂</a> acts as the phonetic, giving the on-reading sui. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="垂.html">垂</a> originally depicts flowers or leaves hanging down, and that image of drooping is transferred to the eyelids: <span class="kanji-inline">睡</span> describes the lids sinking as drowsiness comes on, hence the sense of sleep. Sleep was regarded as serene and beautiful, reflected in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">睡</span><span class="kanji-inline">鷗</span>, the sea gull quietly floating on the water, and <span class="kanji-inline">睡</span><span class="kanji-inline">蓮</span>, the water lily that opens and closes on the water.</p>
