    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">鈴</span> is a phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="令.html">令</a> as its phonetic core. Shirakawa reads <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="令.html">令</a> as a kneeling figure under a deep ritual cap, receiving a divine message, and in this character it carries the clear, summoning ring of a bell. Bells were instruments to invite the gods to descend and to send them off, so <span class="kanji-inline">鈴</span> names the ritual suzu. The same ritual-musical sphere is reflected in related words and forms: <span class="kanji-inline">伶</span><span class="kanji-inline">人</span> were originally attendants serving the gods, later court musicians; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="楽.html">楽</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">樂</span>) shows the form of a handled handbell; and <span class="kanji-inline">玲</span> evokes the bright, jewel-like chime of a tama (ball). In Japanese it is also read rin, as in yobirin, a doorbell.</p>
