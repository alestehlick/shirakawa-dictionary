    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">丙</span> as a pictograph of a pedestal or stand: the base on which a vessel rests, or the butt end of a lance or staff set firmly on the ground. It is the original graph later used as the phonetic in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="柄.html">柄</a>. In early forms seen in characters such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="商.html">商</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">裔</span>, this base functions as a stand for setting a <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辛.html">辛</a> needle upright or for propping up a weapon or cloth. Its use as the name of the third Heavenly Stem (hinoe) is a phonetic loan based on the On reading hei. Paired with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丁.html">丁</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">丙</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丁.html">丁</a>—the third and fourth stems, identified as fire yang and fire yin—evokes the image of a pedestal and a needle. The well-known superstition about women born in a <span class="kanji-inline">丙</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="午.html">午</a> (hinoe-uma) year originated in Ming China, spread widely in Japan from the Edo period, and still lingers today.</p>
