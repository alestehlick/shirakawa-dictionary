    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of a ladle—a spoon-shaped utensil for dipping water and the like. From this image it carries the senses of the hishaku (ladle) and the act of kumu, to ladle. It contrasts with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斗.html">斗</a>, which also depicts a handled scoop but one large enough to measure grain, whereas <span class="kanji-inline">勺</span> is a small scoop; from that small capacity the meaning extends to “a little” or “few.” The more elaborated form <span class="kanji-inline">杓</span> represents the same utensil with additional strokes, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="酌.html">酌</a> expresses the act of ladling out drink, especially liquor.</p>
