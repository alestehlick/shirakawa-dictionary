    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">誇</span> is a phono-semantic character: the speech element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> combines with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">夸</span>, which supplies the on reading ko and evokes a form opened wide. Shirakawa describes <span class="kanji-inline">夸</span> as the figure of a large blade and links it to actions that spread or cut broadly—seen in <span class="kanji-inline">刳</span> (egu, “to gouge, scoop out,” cutting flesh with such a knife) and in <span class="kanji-inline">跨</span> (ko, “to straddle”). From this imagery of something made grand and opened wide, adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> shifts the meaning to speech that is made larger than life—words exaggerated before others—hence “to boast.” This nuance remains in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="浮.html">浮</a><span class="kanji-inline">誇</span> (fuko, showy and inflated) and <span class="kanji-inline">誇</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="誕.html">誕</a> (kotan, extravagant and preposterous).</p>
