    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">朝</span> as a vivid image of dawn: the graph combines grass (<span class="kanji-inline">艸</span>) and the sun (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>), with blades of grass drawn above and below the sun, while the moon (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a>) still lingers—together evoking daybreak. In bronze inscriptions the lower element appears as water (<span class="kanji-inline">水</span>) instead of the moon, suggesting the rising tide of morning. In the Yin (Shang) period, a sunrise rite was held at daybreak, and important state decisions were conducted then, so the character naturally extended to mean the court and affairs of government, as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">朝</span><span class="kanji-inline">政</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">朝</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="見.html">見</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">朝</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="廷.html">廷</a>, and <span class="kanji-inline">朝</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="野.html">野</a>.</p>
