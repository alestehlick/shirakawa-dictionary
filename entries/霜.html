    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">霜</span> is a phono-semantic character formed with the rain radical above and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="相.html">相</a> as the phonetic, which supplies the on reading so. Classical verse in the Book of Odes vividly describes how white dew hardens into frost, capturing the natural process the character names. Early inscriptional forms have even been understood as showing shimobashira—delicate columns of ice that rise from the ground when subsurface water freezes. Because frost is strikingly white, the character naturally extends to images of whiteness and cutting clarity: <span class="kanji-inline">霜</span><span class="kanji-inline">鬢</span> evokes temples turned white as if touched by frost, <span class="kanji-inline">霜</span><span class="kanji-inline">害</span> names the damage frost inflicts on crops, and <span class="kanji-inline">霜</span><span class="kanji-inline">刃</span> suggests a blade bright and keen like frost.</p>
