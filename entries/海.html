    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: the water element signals the realm of water, while the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="毎.html">毎</a> supplies the sound (kai), as seen also in kai of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="悔.html">悔</a> (regret) and <span class="kanji-inline">晦</span> (dark). In its early form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="毎.html">毎</a> depicts a woman with an abundance of hair ornaments, an image of oppressive weight upon the head, suggesting a gloomy, overcast mood. Joined with water, the character came to denote the sea—not only as a body of water, but as the dim, unknown expanse beyond the familiar world. Hence in early Chinese usage, <span class="kanji-inline">四</span><span class="kanji-inline">海</span> did not literally mean seas in the four directions, but the peripheral, primitive lands encircling <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="中.html">中</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="華.html">華</a>, with the sea standing as a symbol of that shadowy outside world.</p>
