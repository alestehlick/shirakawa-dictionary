    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">投</span> is a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="手.html">手</a> “hand” and <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>, a long cane pike that, in ancient practice, was sometimes adorned with bird feathers. <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span> is the original graph for the weapon itself; adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="手.html">手</a> highlights the act of grasping and wielding it. In early usage the character described brandishing or striking with this pike to drive away malevolent spirits in rites of expulsion. A passage in the Zuo Zhuan says <span class="kanji-inline">投</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="諸.html">諸</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="四.html">四</a><span class="kanji-inline">裔</span>, “cast it to the four borders,” vividly conveying the idea of flinging something outward to banish it to the margins. From this ritual sense developed the familiar meanings “to throw” and, especially, “to cast away.”</p>
