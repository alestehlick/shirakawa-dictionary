    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a> as its phonetic element, <span class="kanji-inline">諸</span> originally drew on the ancient image embodied in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a>: the burying of an etsu covenant vessel—a container holding written prayers to the deities—set into the earthen rampart encircling a village to form a protective, apotropaic barrier against outsiders. Because such ritual deposits were made at several points along the wall, the character came to express plurality and abundance, hence “various” and “many.” The same phonetic appears in graphs like <span class="kanji-inline">藷</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">儲</span>, where it evokes the idea of storing within and profusion.</p>
