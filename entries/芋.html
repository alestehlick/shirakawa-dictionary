    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">芋</span> is a phono-semantic character: the grass/plant sign marks it as a plant, while <span class="kanji-inline">于</span> serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on-reading u and evoking something long and large with a softly curved tip. The whole thus names the potato-like tuber, conceived as thick and elongated. A related character for potatoes is <span class="kanji-inline">藷</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">薯</span>) read sho, which incorporates <span class="kanji-inline">者</span> with the sense seen in takuwaeru, “to store up,” suggesting a rounded, substantial form; it refers to tubers that store abundant nutrients in their roots.</p>
