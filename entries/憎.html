    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the heart radical (<span class="kanji-inline">忄</span>) signals an emotion, while <span class="kanji-inline">曾</span> serves as the phonetic element, giving the on reading so/zo and guiding the word’s sound. Shuowen glosses it directly as “to hate,” from which the sense of hatred as a feeling naturally develops. A line in the Book of Rites encapsulates its moral nuance: “When loving one comes to know what is bad; when hating one comes to know what is good,” suggesting that the emotion named by this character can, paradoxically, bring hidden qualities into clearer view.</p>
