    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This compound character sets the clothing element beside a blade, picturing cloth being cut with a knife like scissors in order to make garments. In origin it points to the very first making of clothes—the baby clothes prepared for a newborn—and likely reflects a rite in which the first cut of the cloth was made ceremonially. From that inaugural act the senses “first” and “begin” arise. Many characters read hajime/hajimete likewise grow out of ritual inaugurations in which tools, weapons, or vehicles were purified before first use. Some old forms even link the graph directly with baby garments, underscoring its association with a first undertaking.</p>
