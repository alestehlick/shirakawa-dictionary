    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines <span class="kanji-inline">酉</span>, the wine jar, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="己.html">己</a>, whose older form depicts a person kneeling. It pictures someone kneeling before a wine vessel, the scene of pouring out and handing around drink. From this solemn act of apportionment, the sense expands to distributing or serving, then to matching a man and woman in marriage, and allotting shares. In compounds such as shihai (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="支.html">支</a><span class="kanji-inline">配</span>), it further conveys directing others at one’s will, even subjugating. Related graphs sketch the same ritual setting: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="即.html">即</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">卽</span>) shows a person kneeling before tableware, hence taking one’s seat at the meal; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="郷.html">郷</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">鄕</span>) portrays people seated facing one another with dishes between them.</p>
