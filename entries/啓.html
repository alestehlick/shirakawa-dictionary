    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">啓</span> is a compound that brings together <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戸.html">戸</a> (the single-leaf door of a household shrine), <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span> (often written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a> in older forms, a hand or small striking stick), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>, which here is not a mouth but the sai—a small covenant receptacle for slips bearing prayers to the gods. It depicts a hand opening the shrine’s door to reveal and consult the divine message kept within. From this image arise the senses of opening and enlightening—uncovering what is hidden—and, by extension, respectfully conveying a received message, reflected in formal usages like keijo, keiso, and keihaku. The meaning later widened to edifying or enlightening others, as in keimo. Relatedly, <span class="kanji-inline">肇</span> (chō) evokes the beginning that follows upon receiving such a divine message.</p>
