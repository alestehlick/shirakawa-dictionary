    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of the clustered decorative threads at a garment’s hem, tied off to secure the edge. From that image of threads drawn together it developed senses such as to gather, to bundle, and by extension to encamp or be stationed. In bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">屯</span> is also used for <span class="kanji-inline">純</span> and appears in phrases like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="玄.html">玄</a><span class="kanji-inline">衣</span><span class="kanji-inline">帶</span><span class="kanji-inline">屯</span>, referring to formal ritual attire—black garments with embroidered bands and fixed hem decorations. The character further shades into the idea of being beset or troubled, seen in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">屯</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遭.html">遭</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">屯</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="難.html">難</a>.</p>
