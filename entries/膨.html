    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the left component <span class="kanji-inline">月</span> (nikuzuki, “flesh”) marks a part of the body, while the right component <span class="kanji-inline">彭</span> functions as the phonetic. <span class="kanji-inline">彭</span> itself combines the image of a drum with a sign of resplendence to suggest reverberating drumbeats and, by extension, fullness, vigor, and prosperity. With the flesh radical added, the sense narrows to swelling that seems to rise from within the body, especially in the abdominal area. Hence its core meaning “to swell, to puff up,” seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">膨</span><span class="kanji-inline">大</span> (vast, enormous) and <span class="kanji-inline">膨</span><span class="kanji-inline">張</span> (expansion, swelling).</p>
