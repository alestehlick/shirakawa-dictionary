    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of three pieces of jade threaded on a cord, with early forms even showing the string passing through at the top and bottom, evoking pendant jades that hung from a leather girdle. Ancient people felt that lustrous, adamantine jade held a living energy or spirit, and they fastened it to the body to draw on that power. Jade was also central to funerary rites; the tomb of Queen Consort Fu Hao, wife of the Yin king Wu Ding some 3,300 years ago, yielded a great number of exquisitely worked jades. In Japanese the reading &quot;tama&quot; connects with &quot;tamashii&quot; (spirit), and the graph serves as a laudatory epithet in compounds such as &quot;gyokuza&quot; (the imperial throne).</p>
