    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="相.html">相</a> as its phonetic element, giving the on reading so. Shirakawa interprets <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="相.html">相</a> as a ritual scene: before the form of a thick, luxuriant tree, a spirit banner is waved, and by gazing upon it the viewer’s vital energy is enriched. Carried from this image of focused looking into human relations, <span class="kanji-inline">想</span> comes to mean turning the mind toward something—letting one’s thoughts travel far, thinking of home, and feeling for others. Hence its use in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">想</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="像.html">像</a> (calling to mind things not yet experienced), and later in more abstract notions such as <span class="kanji-inline">想</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="念.html">念</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="思.html">思</a><span class="kanji-inline">想</span>.</p>
