    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">侍</span> is a phono-semantic character: the person radical <span class="kanji-inline">亻</span> signals a human actor, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寺.html">寺</a> provides the sound (ji) and, in early usage, the idea of serving in close attendance. In antiquity, court attendants—especially eunuchs—were called <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寺.html">寺</a><span class="kanji-inline">人</span>, and from the verb <span class="kanji-inline">侍</span>る “to wait upon, attend nearby,” the graph <span class="kanji-inline">侍</span> was formed by adding the person element to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寺.html">寺</a> to express personal service. The graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寺.html">寺</a> itself underlies <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="持.html">持</a> and carries a sense of preserving and maintaining; related graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">恃</span> (to rely), <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="持.html">持</a> (to hold), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="時.html">時</a> (time) share a nuance of continuity. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">侍</span> fundamentally evokes steady, ongoing attendance at someone’s side, a sense that in Japanese later narrowed to the warrior, the “samurai.”</p>
