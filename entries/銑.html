    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character built from the metal radical and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="先.html">先</a> as the phonetic, which supplies the on reading sen. The Shuowen explains it as metal possessing a lustrous sheen, pointing to fine iron. In classical usage it also names the paired lower corners at the mouth of a bronze bell; the Zhou Rites (Kao Gong Ji), in the section on bell makers, notes that “the two corners of the bell’s opening are called <span class="kanji-inline">銑</span>.” In later technical language it came to denote pig iron, the crude, impure iron that runs from the furnace and solidifies in molds.</p>
