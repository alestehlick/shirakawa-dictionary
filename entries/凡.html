    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of a shallow tub or tray, a shape that early writings sometimes rendered with the boat-like form <span class="kanji-inline">舟</span> or reduced to the compact outline of <span class="kanji-inline">凡</span>. Its original on reading han is preserved in derivatives such as <span class="kanji-inline">汎</span> (wide, to float on) and <span class="kanji-inline">帆</span> (sail). In oracle-bone and bronze script, graphs like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="風.html">風</a> (wind) appear as a crested bird, the same motif as the original <span class="kanji-inline">鳳</span> (phoenix); within these, <span class="kanji-inline">凡</span> serves as the on-phonetic. Already in bronze inscriptions <span class="kanji-inline">凡</span> is used adverbially for “all, wholly,” as in <span class="kanji-inline">凡</span>て “everything.” Later it came to mean “ordinary, average,” as seen in <span class="kanji-inline">凡</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a> (mediocre ability), <span class="kanji-inline">凡</span><span class="kanji-inline">人</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">凡</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夫.html">夫</a> (ordinary person), <span class="kanji-inline">非</span><span class="kanji-inline">凡</span> (extraordinary), <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="平.html">平</a><span class="kanji-inline">凡</span> (commonplace), and in <span class="kanji-inline">凡</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="例.html">例</a>, the guide listing a book’s conventions at its opening.</p>
