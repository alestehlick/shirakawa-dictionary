    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a straightforward pictograph of stones massed on a mountainside, capturing the solid presence of a rocky outcrop. In the fuller form <span class="kanji-inline">巖</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="巌.html">巌</a>), two ritual “sai” receptacles holding covenant writings are set upon a cliff (<span class="kanji-inline">崖</span>), and perfumed wine is ladled and poured to purify the sacred site. Such rites were performed on crags because rocky places were revered as abodes of the gods. The common Japanese form <span class="kanji-inline">岩</span> is an abbreviated graph widely used with the meaning “rock,” while <span class="kanji-inline">巖</span> is often seen in Chinese literary usage.</p>
