    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">峽</span>, this is a picto‑phonetic character built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="山.html">山</a>, “mountain,” and <span class="kanji-inline">夾</span>, which serves as the phonetic and also evokes the act of holding something tightly between both arms. In ancient form <span class="kanji-inline">夾</span> depicts a person carrying another under the arms and conveys the sense of being pressed or clamped between. Set beside <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="山.html">山</a>, it describes a place where mountains on both sides squeeze the land into a narrow passage—a gorge or narrows. When water runs through such a constricted place it becomes a valley stream, giving rise to terms like <span class="kanji-inline">峡</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="谷.html">谷</a>, a gorge with steep cliff-like banks on either side.</p>
