    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character <span class="kanji-inline">県</span> goes back to the older form <span class="kanji-inline">縣</span>, which depicts a head hung upside down from a cord: the rope is shown by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="系.html">系</a>, while the disheveled hair hanging below renders the image vividly. From this scene the graph first meant “to hang” or “to suspend,” and that verbal sense was later assigned to the separately created character <span class="kanji-inline">懸</span>. Meanwhile <span class="kanji-inline">縣</span> (and later the simplified <span class="kanji-inline">県</span>) was adopted for an administrative unit. In the Zhou period it referred to districts directly subordinate to the central authority; after Qin unification it designated counties placed under prefectures (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="郡.html">郡</a>). In Japan, with the 1871 abolition of the feudal domains, the establishment of three urban prefectures (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="府.html">府</a>) and 302 <span class="kanji-inline">県</span> marked the beginning of the modern prefectural system.</p>
