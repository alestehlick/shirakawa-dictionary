    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">壯</span>, this is a phono-semantic character. The component <span class="kanji-inline">爿</span> depicts a low ritual table with legs on which sacrificial meat was set, and it could also serve as an emblem of royal kinship, as for princes of the Yin house. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a> shows the head of a small battle-axe, the badge of the warrior rank. Closely related graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">將</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="将.html">将</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="将.html">将</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="軍.html">軍</a> portray the figure who bears the sacrificial meat after prayers for victory and goes on to lead the army. Within this ritual–military sphere, <span class="kanji-inline">壮</span> designated a warrior of royal descent, the core of a war band; from that status it developed the senses of robust vigor and grandeur, seen in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="強.html">強</a><span class="kanji-inline">壮</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">壮</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="健.html">健</a>, and <span class="kanji-inline">壮</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>.</p>
