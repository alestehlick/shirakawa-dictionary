    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">約</span> is a picto-phonetic character. Its phonetic is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勺.html">勺</a>, the shape of a slightly bent ladle handle, which signals the on reading yaku. The graph itself evokes bending and tying a cord, so it came to mean to tie or bind, a knot, and by extension an oath. The content of a promise was once indicated by the number and form of knots, making <span class="kanji-inline">約</span> the word for an agreed pledge, as in <span class="kanji-inline">約</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="束.html">束</a>. From this it also developed the sense of what is broadly set or taken in outline, hence “general, approximate,” as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a><span class="kanji-inline">約</span>. In antiquity, <span class="kanji-inline">約</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="剤.html">剤</a> referred to important treaty documents, <span class="kanji-inline">剂</span> indicating an inscription cut with a knife on a square tripod.</p>
