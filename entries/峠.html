    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A Japanese-made character, <span class="kanji-inline">峠</span> depicts the crucial saddle of a mountain path—the point where climbing gives way to descent. Its form combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="山.html">山</a> with the signs for “up” and “down,” visually marking that moment of transition. Such passes were revered as dwelling places of the gods: travelers worshipped the road deities (dosoji n) there and made offerings (tamuke). The word toge itself is understood as a shifted pronunciation of tamuke. From this sense comes the expression toge o kosu, meaning that the peak of vigor has passed and decline has begun. The character <span class="kanji-inline">裃</span> (kamishimo) is another kokuji built on the same structural idea.</p>
