    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of running: the upper element sketches a human figure with one arm raised, the other lowered, the body leaning forward in a runner’s posture, while the lower element <span class="kanji-inline">止</span> shows footprints or steps, emphasizing forward motion. Hence the basic sense is to run. From this base, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奔.html">奔</a> was formed by combining the same figure with multiple <span class="kanji-inline">止</span> to express even swifter running, giving compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奔.html">奔</a><span class="kanji-inline">走</span>, ‘to run about busily,’ a term used in ritual contexts for the rapid movements required during worship, as in the Sacrificial Odes of the Book of Odes: ‘Grandly they hurried about in the temple.’</p>
