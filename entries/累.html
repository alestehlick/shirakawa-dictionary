    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">累</span> as a picto‑phonetic graph. Its phonetic element, which depicts earth heaped up, gives the on reading rui and suggests the notion of piling. Combined with the thread element, the character evokes loose thread ends gathering into little heaps—an image that yields the senses “to pile up,” “to increase,” and “to add again and again,” hence also “repeatedly.” From there it extends to the idea of being tied and encumbered, as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">累</span><span class="kanji-inline">心</span> (a heart burdened with worries) and <span class="kanji-inline">係</span><span class="kanji-inline">累</span> (ties and dependents), and so also carries the meanings “to bind” and “to trouble.”</p>
