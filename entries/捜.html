    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa analyzes <span class="kanji-inline">捜</span> as a phono‑semantic compound whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">搜</span>: the hand radical is added to <span class="kanji-inline">叟</span> (sou), which serves as the phonetic. He traces <span class="kanji-inline">叟</span> back to an earlier form related to <span class="kanji-inline">穸</span>, depicting a hand holding a flame under a roof, the torch used by the clan elder during ancestral rites in the mausoleum. From the image of lifting a light to seek things in the dark, the character came to mean “to search,” and by extension “to visit.” The same phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">叟</span> also underlies <span class="kanji-inline">嫂</span> (sou), “elder brother’s wife,” the woman who served in the mausoleum, reflecting the same ritual background.</p>
