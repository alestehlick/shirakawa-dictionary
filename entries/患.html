    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the top element is <span class="kanji-inline">串</span> (closely related to <span class="kanji-inline">毌</span> and to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貫.html">貫</a> when paired with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>), originally depicting shells strung and bound together—shells that served as money in antiquity. Set above <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a> “heart,” it not only supplies the sound kan but also evokes the uneasy state born of such precarious wealth: bound shells knock against one another and chip, prompting anxiety and fretting. From this sense of worry and trouble the meaning extended to illness, viewed as the most intense source of concern; hence compounds like byokan (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="病.html">病</a><span class="kanji-inline">患</span>) come to mean “disease.” The character thus began with the idea of economic anxiety and broadened to general affliction.</p>
