    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">示</span> began as a pictograph of an altar or offering table set before the deities. In early inscriptions a horizontal top is drawn with lines descending from it—sometimes three, sometimes a single stroke—suggestive of a sacred emanation. The sacrificial graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="祭.html">祭</a> makes the scene explicit: a piece of meat (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> used in its old sense of “meat”) is placed on the altar with a hand <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a> to make an offering. When the altar is drawn large, with its crossed, tightly braced legs, it gives the form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="帝.html">帝</a>, the august heavenly deity. Because <span class="kanji-inline">示</span> designates the divine sphere, it stands at the heart of words about gods and rites (as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="神.html">神</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="神.html">神</a><span class="kanji-inline">示</span> “divine revelation”), and from this base it also came to be used in place of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="視.html">視</a>, giving the extended sense “to show.”</p>
