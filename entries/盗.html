    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">盗</span> as a compound graph whose earliest form pairs <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="次.html">次</a> with a dish of blood. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="次.html">次</a> itself combines water with a figure shown mouth agape and drooling—the same imagery that underlies the character for slobber—while the dish signifies blood set out for a solemn rite. Put together, <span class="kanji-inline">盗</span> depicts saliva defiling the blood in a ritual bowl at a blood-oath ceremony. From this vivid scene it came to mean the one who desecrates and breaks a sworn pact: a traitor to the community. In early usage, refugees and defectors could be branded <span class="kanji-inline">盗</span>, and even Confucius, during his periods of exile, was treated as such. Closely related is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="賊.html">賊</a>, which shows a sacred oath engraved on a bronze tripod being gouged with a halberd—another image of oath-breaking. Both graphs originally denoted public criminals; only later did <span class="kanji-inline">盗</span> develop its common senses of “to steal” and “thief.”</p>
