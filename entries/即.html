    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form <span class="kanji-inline">卽</span> combines a ritual food vessel—identified with the gui bronze offering vessel, written here with the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="自.html">自</a>—and <span class="kanji-inline">卩</span>, a kneeling person. It pictures someone kneeling before a served meal and taking a seat, which gives the sense of tsuku, “to take one’s seat,” and by extension “to accede, to ascend (the throne),” as in sokui. From the concrete scene of taking one’s place (sokuseki), the meaning broadened to “on the spot, immediately,” and the character is also used, like soku (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="則.html">則</a>), to mean “namely; that is.” Related graphs evoke the same setting: <span class="kanji-inline">鄕</span> shows people seated facing each other with the vessel between them, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="既.html">既</a> depicts a sated person turning away from the vessel after the meal.</p>
