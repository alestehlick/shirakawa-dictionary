    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">戸</span> is a pictograph of a single-leaf, swinging door—the hinged panel of a household deity board or small shrine (kamidana). In contrast to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a>, the double-leaf gate, this single door marked the sacred threshold separating the inner and outer realms. Oracle-bone inscriptions even record worship at triple shrines as <span class="kanji-inline">三</span><span class="kanji-inline">戸</span> or <span class="kanji-inline">三</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a>. From this cultic setting developed related graphs: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="啓.html">啓</a> originally depicted opening such a door by hand to consult a sacred receptacle (sai) that held covenant petitions to the gods, and by extension came to mean receiving a divine message; <span class="kanji-inline">肇</span> expressed the beginning of receiving such revelation. Because every dwelling contained such a sacred place, <span class="kanji-inline">戸</span> naturally came to signify a household unit, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="一.html">一</a><span class="kanji-inline">戸</span>, extending from the concrete “door” to the idea of “household” and “family.”</p>
