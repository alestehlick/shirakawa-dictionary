    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">召</span> as a compound showing a person descending from above set over a mouth-shaped ritual receptacle (sai), a container for covenant or prayer writings. The graph depicts placing a petition and, in answer, the spirit of the dead descending to the altar, which gives the core sense of calling down and summoning a spirit. In early Zhou bronze inscriptions, the graph in the name of Duke Zhao (shao) appears with scenes of wine offerings, prayer, and the welcoming of the descending spirit, marking him as a ritual specialist who anticipated divine descent. From this cultic nucleus, related forms unfold naturally: adding “hand” yields <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="招.html">招</a>, the physical act of beckoning; adding “speech” gives <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="詔.html">詔</a>, a transmitted message from the summoned deity. Graphs such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="各.html">各</a> express a deity’s descent from heaven, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="客.html">客</a> portrays a ‘guest deity’ entering the ancestral hall. From summoning gods, the meaning broadened to inviting or calling people.</p>
