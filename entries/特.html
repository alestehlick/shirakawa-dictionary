    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound formed with the ox radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="牛.html">牛</a> and the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寺.html">寺</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">特</span> was explained in the Shuowen as “a big male ox,” evoking the image of a prime, imposing bull. From this sense of a distinguished animal, the word came to describe human excellence: in the Mao tradition of the Book of Odes it is used of a man outstanding among a hundred, hence meanings such as “to excel” and “to be different, set apart.” In later usage it can also substitute for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="独.html">独</a> to mean “alone,” which underlies the adverbial sense of “only” and “especially” found in modern Japanese.</p>
