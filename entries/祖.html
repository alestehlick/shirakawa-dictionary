    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">祖</span> as a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a> marks the realm of ritual, while the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="且.html">且</a> (read so) originally depicted a <span class="kanji-inline">俎</span>, the sacrificial chopping board on which offerings were arrayed. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="且.html">且</a> itself already functions with the meaning “ancestor,” standing as the earliest form of <span class="kanji-inline">祖</span>. Early ritual depictions show strips of meat—written with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夕.html">夕</a> as an abbreviation of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肉.html">肉</a>—placed above and below the <span class="kanji-inline">俎</span> within the ancestral shrine. When the altar sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a> was later added to make the sacrificial setting explicit, the graph took the form <span class="kanji-inline">祖</span>. From the reverence for forebears as the first in a lineage, the sense naturally extends to “origin” or “foundation,” and, because ancestors serve as exemplars, to the notion of a model or standard.</p>
