    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">價</span>, this is a phono-semantic character built on <span class="kanji-inline">賈</span> as its phonetic. Because <span class="kanji-inline">賈</span> denotes trade—buying and selling—it supplies both the sound ka and the commercial sense, and the simplified form <span class="kanji-inline">価</span> carries this forward. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">価</span> expresses the value or price of things, their worth (as in <span class="kanji-inline">価</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="値.html">値</a>), and by extension appears in words for appraisal and evaluation (<span class="kanji-inline">評</span><span class="kanji-inline">価</span>), the act of determining that value.</p>
