    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">題</span> is a phono-semantic character built from <span class="kanji-inline">是</span> as the sound element and <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span> as the meaning element. <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span> depicts a person bowing in reverence with ritual headgear and functions as the ‘head/face’ indicator. <span class="kanji-inline">是</span>, originally the form of a spoon or ladle, when applied to the human face was associated with the upper part—the forehead. The Shuowen explicitly glosses it as ‘forehead,’ and in early usage it could mean the brow or the head more generally. From the idea of the forehead as the central front of the face, the sense extended to plaques hung at the front center of a room (<span class="kanji-inline">題</span><span class="kanji-inline">額</span>), and by further development to inscribing or writing a title—hence the modern meanings of ‘title’ and ‘to write down.’</p>
