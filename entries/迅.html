    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">迅</span> is a phono-semantic character. The left side is the movement sign <span class="kanji-inline">辶</span>, which gives the idea of going or speed, while the right side is <span class="kanji-inline">卂</span>, an ancient graph explained in the Shuowen as “flying swiftly,” derived from the form of <span class="kanji-inline">飛</span> ‘to fly’ with the wings left unseen—an image of a body cutting through the air too fast for its wings to be distinguished. Later understanding connects this shape with the falcon <span class="kanji-inline">隼</span>, emblem of extreme speed. With <span class="kanji-inline">卂</span> lending the sound and the bird-in-flight image, and <span class="kanji-inline">辶</span> supplying the motion sense, the character came to mean swift, rapid, and by extension, intense.</p>
