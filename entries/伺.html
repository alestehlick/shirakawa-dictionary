    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph formed with the person element and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="司.html">司</a>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="司.html">司</a> supplies the on reading shi and evokes its older sense: an officiant presiding over rites, intoning prayers and petitions to the gods. <span class="kanji-inline">伺</span> thus depicts a person who approaches and sounds out the divine will, which gives the core meaning ukagau, to inquire. The nuance of seeking a sign by looking out into the distance is felt in compounds with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="望.html">望</a>, as in <span class="kanji-inline">伺</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="望.html">望</a>, and it extends to observing another’s intentions and conduct, as in <span class="kanji-inline">伺</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="察.html">察</a>. By association it can also stand in the place of <span class="kanji-inline">覗</span>, to look or peep.</p>
