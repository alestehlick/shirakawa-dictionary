    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">拷</span> is a phono-semantic character: the hand element signals an act carried out with the hands, while the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="考.html">考</a> gives the on reading gou. Although it is absent from the Shuowen, later lexica such as the Yù Pian gloss it simply as “to beat.” In practice it referred to the beating of a suspect during interrogation, and so it came to mean both striking and, more specifically, torture. The historical record mentions methods such as caning and even injuring or cutting fingers (a practice called sasshi), and from this usage derive compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">拷</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="問.html">問</a> for torture and <span class="kanji-inline">拷</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="具.html">具</a> for torture implements.</p>
