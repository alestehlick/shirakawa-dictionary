    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound graph combining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="山.html">山</a> (mountain), <span class="kanji-inline">厂</span> (the profile of a cliff), and <span class="kanji-inline">火</span> (fire). The cliff-shaped <span class="kanji-inline">厂</span> suggests a rock face, and together the elements picture fire set beneath a mountainside—an image of making charcoal in a kiln or pit against a cliff. From this scene comes the meaning “charcoal.” Classical texts already tie the practice to season and use: the Huainanzi notes that at the end of autumn, when grasses and trees yellow and fall, people cut brushwood and make charcoal; and the Baopuzi praises the preservative power of carbonization, saying that once wood is burned into charcoal it endures for ages without decay.</p>
