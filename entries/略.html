    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="各.html">各</a> as its phonetic, <span class="kanji-inline">略</span> takes its on reading from the same source seen in <span class="kanji-inline">洛</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="絡.html">絡</a>. The Shuowen glosses it as the act of managing and regulating territory, hence the core sense of running affairs: to govern, to carry on, to devise policy—hence ‘stratagem.’ By association with <span class="kanji-inline">掠</span> (ryaku, ‘to plunder’), it also comes to mean taking by force, as in <span class="kanji-inline">略</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="取.html">取</a>, and thus ‘to seize’ or ‘to rob.’ From this managerial and selective sense grows its use for what is handled in outline rather than in full: ‘outline,’ ‘roughly, almost’ (as in <span class="kanji-inline">略</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="知.html">知</a>), and the idea of abbreviation and omission (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="省.html">省</a><span class="kanji-inline">略</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">略</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="解.html">解</a>). In short, it moves from governing and planning to capturing, and then to the concise treatment of things.</p>
