    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a simple pictograph: a conspicuous sign set up to mark where the market was held. Because markets drew crowds, a tall marker was erected and a steward oversaw the space beneath it. Some early variants added a small element like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a> above, taken as a cue for the sound shi, but since that addition did not survive in the received form, <span class="kanji-inline">市</span> is best understood as the bare signboard itself. From this origin it came to denote the market and the buying and selling that took place there, and by extension a town or city defined by having such a market. In antiquity, the <span class="kanji-inline">市</span> was also a lively social venue—site of festive song gatherings (utagaki) where young men and women met to sing, feast, dance, and freely mingle.</p>
