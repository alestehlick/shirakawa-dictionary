    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">雅</span> is a phono-semantic character: <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span> shows a small bird, while <span class="kanji-inline">牙</span> supplies the sound, understood as echoing a crow’s cry. Early glosses already treat <span class="kanji-inline">雅</span> as a kind of crow; in this bird-name series many graphs set <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span> for “bird” and add a phonetic suggesting the call (as with <span class="kanji-inline">鶴</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">鳩</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">雉</span>). From this base the graph entered the sphere of court performance: the Major and Minor Odes of the Book of Odes—songs for aristocratic ceremonial dances—are titled <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a><span class="kanji-inline">雅</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="小.html">小</a><span class="kanji-inline">雅</span>. In older usage these titles could also be written with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夏.html">夏</a>, a figure of a court dancer, or with <span class="kanji-inline">疋</span>, a shorthand form depicting a raised-legged dance, with <span class="kanji-inline">雅</span> functioning as a phonetic substitute in the transmitted text. Because these sections expressed the cultivated tastes and manners of the elite, <span class="kanji-inline">雅</span> came to mean elegance and refinement; in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">雅</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> it further signifies proper, correct speech.</p>
