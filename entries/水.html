    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph of water in motion: a strong central stream flanked by smaller currents on either side. In early scripts a broad river could be drawn as three flowing lines (the form that became <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="川.html">川</a>), while <span class="kanji-inline">水</span> could also indicate a more modest flow. From this image come related forms: when such a small current freezes, adding two “ice” marks yields <span class="kanji-inline">冰</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="氷.html">氷</a>, meaning ice. As a component on the left of other characters, it appears as the three-dot water radical, sanzui.</p>
