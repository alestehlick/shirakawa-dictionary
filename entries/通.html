    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">通</span> is a phono-semantic character built from <span class="kanji-inline">甬</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">辶</span>). The element <span class="kanji-inline">甬</span>, also seen as the phonetic in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="痛.html">痛</a>, originally depicts a bucket—a hollow, tube-like vessel—and supplies both the sound and the image of a cylindrical passage. <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> conveys the act of going or walking. Together they express the idea of moving through a hollow space, passing smoothly without obstruction. From this core sense arise broader uses: to pass through, to go back and forth, to reach and pervade, and by extension to be widespread or universal.</p>
