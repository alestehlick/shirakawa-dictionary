    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">赴</span> takes its sound from the component <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span> (read boku in Sino-Japanese), which serves as the on-reading cue; the same phonetic appears in characters like <span class="kanji-inline">訃</span> (“death notice”) and <span class="kanji-inline">仆</span> (“to fall”). The Shuowen defines <span class="kanji-inline">赴</span> as hastening toward—going or coming quickly—so it naturally extends to “proceed,” “go,” and “face toward.” In the Zuo Zhuan, <span class="kanji-inline">訃</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="告.html">告</a> is the dispatch of a messenger to announce a death, and in bronze inscriptions <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="告.html">告</a> (“to announce”) refers specifically to that act. Because <span class="kanji-inline">訃</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="告.html">告</a> involves conveying news across a distance, <span class="kanji-inline">訃</span> seems to carry within it the sense of “going toward” embodied by <span class="kanji-inline">赴</span>. In modern usage, <span class="kanji-inline">訃</span> remains in words like <span class="kanji-inline">訃</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="報.html">報</a> (“news of a death”), while <span class="kanji-inline">赴</span> appears vividly in <span class="kanji-inline">赴</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="任.html">任</a>, the journey to take up a new post.</p>
