    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">詩</span> is a phono-semantic character: the left side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> marks speech, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寺.html">寺</a> supplies the sound value shi; in some early forms the right side is <span class="kanji-inline">之</span>, likewise indicating the reading. From the outset it meant putting what is held in the heart into spoken form. The Great Foreword to the Book of Odes expresses this: what is cherished as intent within becomes poetry when uttered in words. In antiquity such poems were often chants performed before the deities—voiced offerings whose verses were believed to activate the spirit-power of words (kotodama), inviting auspicious response and effecting incantatory force. Over time, the term broadened to embrace the literary expression of human feelings. Japanese uta, too, grew out of appeals and petitions to the gods (as in uttaeru, to entreat), and many early song genres began as incantatory “curse songs” grounded in faith in the efficacy of utterance before evolving into works prized for their literary qualities.</p>
