    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph, <span class="kanji-inline">律</span> takes its On reading from <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span> (itsu), the picture of a brush held in the hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>). In early practice, setting down the brush was how positions and arrangements were fixed—like laying out the plan of a building—and by extension how matters were authoritatively made public. From this notion of uniformly setting and proclaiming standards, the character came to signify law, rules, and established regulations.</p>
