    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">虞</span> as a picto‑phonetic graph built from the tiger radical and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="呉.html">呉</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">吳</span>) as its phonetic. In ancient imagery, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="呉.html">呉</a> depicts a worshiper dancing in prayer, raising a ritual sai—an offering vessel that received written petitions to the gods. With the tiger component, <span class="kanji-inline">虞</span> portrays a ritual dancer clad in a tiger’s hide, a sacred performance to delight the deities. This aligns with characters like <span class="kanji-inline">戲</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="劇.html">劇</a>, which originally referred to ceremonies held before battle to invoke victory. From its early sense of consulting the gods about military ventures, the character came to express awe before divine authority and thus developed the meanings “to fear,” “fear,” and by extension “danger.”</p>
