    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of the back of an animal’s paw, with the upper element <span class="kanji-inline">釆</span> portraying a claw, so that the whole figure shows the paw’s top side complete with claws. The ancient Shuowen already glossed it as “an animal’s paw.” In later writing the anatomical sense was assigned to <span class="kanji-inline">蹯</span>, while <span class="kanji-inline">番</span> developed into meanings of alternation and orderly succession—one’s turn, a numbered sequence, and standing watch or duty taken in rotation.</p>
