    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">昨</span> is a phono-semantic character. The element <span class="kanji-inline">乍</span> serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on-reading saku; <span class="kanji-inline">乍</span> itself originally depicted branches bent to make a fence. In older usage a near-homophonous graph, <span class="kanji-inline">徂</span> (“to go”), with the sense of “immediately,” sometimes appeared in its place, and the sound also resonated with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="昔.html">昔</a> (seki, “former times”), which in antiquity could even be used for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夕.html">夕</a>, “evening.” With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>, “day,” added as the semantic indicator, the character came to signify “the day before,” that is, yesterday.</p>
