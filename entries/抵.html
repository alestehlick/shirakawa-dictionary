    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Composed of the hand radical and the phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">氐</span>, this is a phono-semantic character that pictures exerting force with the hand. <span class="kanji-inline">氐</span>, originally showing a handled knife trimming the bottom of something flat, contributes both sound and the sense of making a base even. Classical glosses already understood the word as pressing or pushing, and by extension recommending or advancing something. From the idea of applying the hand’s force to press on or push aside, the character comes to mean to resist, refuse, or go against. It also suggests two sides brought to an even level, which underlies uses like <span class="kanji-inline">抵</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="当.html">当</a>, where property stands as an equivalent counterbalance pledged against a debt.</p>
