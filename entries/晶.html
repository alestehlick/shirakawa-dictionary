    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character depicts the radiance of the stars. By arranging the sun/star element three times, it intensifies the image of light, yielding senses such as clear and shining. The related graph <span class="kanji-inline">昌</span>, which combines two of the same element, already conveys burgeoning brightness and prosperity; with three, the brilliance is heightened. Old forms of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="星.html">星</a> even show a variant that places <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="生.html">生</a> beneath <span class="kanji-inline">晶</span>, underscoring its link to starlight. Because the light of stars is brilliance without heat, <span class="kanji-inline">水</span><span class="kanji-inline">晶</span> (rock crystal) names a substance that gleams with that cold, lucid light.</p>
