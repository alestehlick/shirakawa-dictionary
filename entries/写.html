    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its older form <span class="kanji-inline">寫</span>, the character combines <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span>, the roof of the ancestral mausoleum, with <span class="kanji-inline">舄</span>, the decorated ceremonial shoes worn for rites. It first evoked entering the mausoleum in those formal shoes, which implied removing the ordinary pair at the threshold. From this ritual act of exchanging footwear, the graph took on the sense of taking off and shifting, then more generally of transferring something—an idea that naturally developed into “copying,” moving a text or form from one place to another. The same element <span class="kanji-inline">舄</span> appears in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="潟.html">潟</a>, “lagoon,” which depicts a shoreline where the tide withdraws, likewise suggesting removal and displacement.</p>
