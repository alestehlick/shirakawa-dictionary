    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character sets the walking sign <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, which suggests going or acting outward, beside <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皮.html">皮</a>, used here for its sound hi. In form it looks like a phonetic compound implying movement, but in usage it came to write the pronouns “he” and “that.” Already in bronze inscriptions <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皮.html">皮</a> appears as a pronoun, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皮.html">皮</a><span class="kanji-inline">之</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="吉.html">吉</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="人.html">人</a>, read kano kitsujin, meaning “this fortunate man.” To distinguish this pronominal <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皮.html">皮</a> from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皮.html">皮</a> meaning “hide, leather,” the step radical <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span> was added, yielding <span class="kanji-inline">彼</span>. In the set <span class="kanji-inline">彼</span><span class="kanji-inline">此</span>, “that and this,” note that <span class="kanji-inline">此</span> originally meant “something small,” and, like <span class="kanji-inline">彼</span>, was later employed as a demonstrative by borrowing its sound.</p>
