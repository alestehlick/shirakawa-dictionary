    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the grass radical <span class="kanji-inline">艹</span> signals a plant, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="方.html">方</a> serves as the phonetic element that gives the on reading hou. The ancient Shuowen defines it as “fragrant grass,” that is, a flower with a sweet perfume. From this core sense of pleasant scent it naturally denotes sweetness and fragrance, and, by figurative transfer to people, it becomes an honorific term for kindly intention and considerate feeling, as well as for a fine reputation and an esteemed name.</p>
