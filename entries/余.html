    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">餘</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="食.html">食</a> “food” provides the semantic frame of provisions, while <span class="kanji-inline">余</span> supplies the sound. In the Shuowen it is glossed as <span class="kanji-inline">饒</span> “abundant,” evoking plentiful food; from this sprang the later, general sense of what is left over—excess and remainder. In modern usage the simplified <span class="kanji-inline">余</span> stands as the standard form for <span class="kanji-inline">餘</span>. Shirakawa further distinguishes another <span class="kanji-inline">余</span> depicting a long-handled needle. In medical imagery this tool pierces an abscess and drains it into a basin, which underlies the sense of recovery in graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">愈</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="愉.html">愉</a>; as a ritual implement it was thrust into the earth to expel malign spirits hidden below, a nuance that colors <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="徐.html">徐</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="途.html">途</a> with the idea of an eased, purified way. The use of <span class="kanji-inline">余</span> as the first-person pronoun “I” is a later loan based on its sound.</p>
