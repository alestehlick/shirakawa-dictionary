    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">酌</span> is a phono-semantic graph: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勺.html">勺</a>, read shaku and shaped like a ladle, supplies the sound, while <span class="kanji-inline">酉</span>, the wine jar, provides the meaning. Together they depict drawing wine from a cask with a ladle. In early usage it evokes pouring wine into cups and letting it circulate among guests—the exchanging of cups in a convivial drinking bout. Because ladling entails apportioning the amount, the character naturally extended to the idea of gauging and adjusting to circumstances, as reflected in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">斟</span><span class="kanji-inline">酌</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">酌</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="量.html">量</a>, where it denotes thoughtful consideration and measured allowance.</p>
