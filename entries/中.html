    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads this character as a pictograph of a military standard. In the oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, it appears as a vertical pole with streamers fastened at both top and bottom—the kind of flag used to signal battlefield maneuvers. In the Yin dynasty, forces were arrayed as left, middle, and right armies; this was the banner of the middle army, whose general, acting as marshal, could command the whole. From that emblem of the central command the graph came to mean the middle or center, and by extension the inside/within, and even what is proper or correct.</p>
