    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">送</span> as a phono-semantic graph in which the element <span class="kanji-inline">矣</span> serves as the phonetic and, in its archaic form, depicts both hands holding something out in offering. From this image the earliest sense was to bestow a present—hence to send or present something—and bronze inscriptions such as the Mao Gong Ding preserve this meaning in phrases of bestowal. The sense later broadened to sending people as well, for example dispatching attendants to escort a bride, as seen in <span class="kanji-inline">媵</span>. Characters like <span class="kanji-inline">矣</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">送</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">佚</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">媵</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">賸</span> thus form a lineage centered on the act of sending or presenting.</p>
