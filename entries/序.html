    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">序</span> as a picto-phonetic graph. Its semantic side shows the eaved side-corridors that flanked a main hall—long, roofed spaces where instruction took place—hence expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">庠</span><span class="kanji-inline">序</span> for a school. The phonetic is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="予.html">予</a>, originally the form of a weaving shuttle (<span class="kanji-inline">杼</span>) that slips back and forth through the warp and weft. From that steady passage arose the idea of following in sequence, giving <span class="kanji-inline">序</span> the senses of “order,” “discipline,” and “next,” as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="秩.html">秩</a><span class="kanji-inline">序</span>. The phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="予.html">予</a> also marks the on reading jo, seen in related characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">杼</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">紓</span>. By extension, <span class="kanji-inline">序</span> can stand in place of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="緒.html">緒</a>, evoking the “end of a thread” and thus a “beginning,” which underlies its use for a preface.</p>
