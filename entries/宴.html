    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">宴</span> joins the roof sign <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span>, evoking the eaves of an ancestral hall, with a woman beneath it performing the tamafuri, a “spirit‑waving” rite using a jade. This ceremony was meant to stir and enrich human vitality, and it was carried out in a secluded inner space, under cover. From this ritual scene the character first expressed soothing and calming the heart—feeling at ease—and by extension taking pleasure. Only later did it become the word for a drinking feast. The related form <span class="kanji-inline">偃</span> (en, “to lie down”) reflects the same rite in the posture of a woman bending forward with jade in hand.</p>
