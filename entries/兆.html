    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">兆</span> began as a pictograph of crack lines produced in shell-and-bone divination. Diviners drilled a long, jujube-shaped hole (saku) lengthwise on the inner face of a tortoise plastron and a bowl-shaped hole (san) crosswise, then applied heat so the shell split. The resulting fissures ran vertically from the saku and horizontally from the san; their crossing gives the basic <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span> sign for a divinatory crack. <span class="kanji-inline">兆</span> sets two such <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span> marks facing each other, evoking the paired crack patterns that were read as omens. From this image it came to mean a sign or portent, and by extension the showing of signs or a beginning. In later usage it was also adopted as a numeral, denoting ten thousand times a hundred million—that is, one trillion.</p>
