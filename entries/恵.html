    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character goes back to the older form <span class="kanji-inline">惠</span>. In the later form <span class="kanji-inline">恵</span>, the element shaped like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="吏.html">吏</a>—understood here as the figure of a tied-up sack—serves only as a phonetic that carries the on-reading kei; it contributes no meaning. Bronze inscriptions still write the original <span class="kanji-inline">惠</span>. In early usage, <span class="kanji-inline">惠</span> more often described a heart drawn tight and on guard, hence senses like being reverent and admonishing. From that vigilant tension of the mind the meaning softened over time to showing favor and tenderness: to have mercy, to cherish, and to be kind.</p>
