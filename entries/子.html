    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the earliest inscriptions the character is a direct picture of an infant: oracle-bone forms show the large head of a newborn with sprouting hair. Other early shapes depict a small figure with one arm raised and the other lowered, a posture signaling rank, and thus portray the child as a prince. From this initial sense of “prince,” the graph broadened to the general meaning “child.” By extension it could also denote a man, a lord, or a “Master” in the honorific sense applied to teachers. The same graph names the first of the Twelve Earthly Branches, zi (Japanese ne), associated with the rat.</p>
