    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines the cliff sign <span class="kanji-inline">厂</span> with the hand <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>. It pictures a hand braced against a steep cliff as someone claws upward; the sheer face throws the body back, giving the sense of being overturned and of going against. In bronze inscriptions <span class="kanji-inline">反</span> is commonly used for <span class="kanji-inline">叛</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="逆.html">逆</a>—rebellion and breach of faith—likely evoking the attempt to clamber up and violate a sacred precinct, an act of defiance. From this it came to mean to oppose or go against, and also to turn back or put back. The later graph <span class="kanji-inline">叛</span> adds the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="半.html">半</a> to <span class="kanji-inline">反</span>, but <span class="kanji-inline">反</span> is the original form. In Japanese it also appears in verbs like soru and sorasu, ‘to arch or bend (the body) back.’</p>
