    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">階</span> as a phono-semantic compound: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皆.html">皆</a> provides the sound kai, while the left component <span class="kanji-inline">阝</span> (from <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span>) originally depicts the ladder used by deities to ascend and descend. He further sees <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皆.html">皆</a> as the orderly ranks of spirits coming down in answer to prayer, so the earliest meaning of <span class="kanji-inline">階</span> is the stairway prepared for the gods’ descent from heaven. In ritual settings, altars were raised on earthen platforms, with clay steps built in front; from this context the character came to mean steps and staircases in general, and later extended to graded levels such as social rank, as in <span class="kanji-inline">階</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="級.html">級</a>.</p>
