    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">從</span>, the graph centers on <span class="kanji-inline">从</span>, a figure of people aligned and turning to the left. In the later form <span class="kanji-inline">従</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">从</span> functions as the phonetic element that gives the on reading ju, while <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, the “step” radical, adds the sense of walking along a small path. Together they depict someone proceeding behind another on the road, hence the meaning “to follow,” which later broadened to following or complying in general.</p>
