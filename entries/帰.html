    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">歸</span>, the graph joined the sign for sacrificial meat with <span class="kanji-inline">帚</span>, the ritual broom sprinkled with wine to purify an ancestral mausoleum; by metonymy, the broom came to signify the mausoleum itself. Later the footstep sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a> was added to express the act of going back. Before a campaign, meat was offered in the ancestral mausoleum and the military shrine, and the army set out carrying that consecrated meat as a protective presence. On victorious return they reported their safe homecoming to the ancestors in the mausoleum and presented the worship meat—this rite is what <span class="kanji-inline">歸</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">帰</span> names. From that specific homecoming ceremony the meaning broadened to returning in general, and by the same logic it also came to denote a woman’s marrying into another family, as she announced her new status before the family’s ancestral spirits to be welcomed among them.</p>
