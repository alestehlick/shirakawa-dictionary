    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">外</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span>. In the oldest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> depicts a piece of flesh (the same idea later written with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a>), while <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span> marks divination. In shell-and-bone divination the flesh was stripped from a hard-shelled “outer-boned” turtle to take its plastron for use in the rite, so the meat element evokes killing and scraping away, and <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span> signals the act of divining. Oracle-bone inscriptions even write the Shang king names later transmitted as <span class="kanji-inline">外</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丙.html">丙</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">外</span><span class="kanji-inline">壬</span> as <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丙.html">丙</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span><span class="kanji-inline">壬</span>, showing that <span class="kanji-inline">外</span> originally belonged to the vocabulary of turtle-plastron divination. From that ritual sense the character broadened to mean “outside” in contrast to “inside” (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="内.html">内</a><span class="kanji-inline">外</span>), and by extension the exterior or surface, something other or elsewhere, and the verbal sense “to remove, take off.”</p>
