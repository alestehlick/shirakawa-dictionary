    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">撮</span> is a phono-semantic character: the hand element (<span class="kanji-inline">扌</span>) signals a manual action, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="最.html">最</a> functions as the phonetic and carries an old image. Shirakawa explains <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="最.html">最</a> as formed from a flesh component and <span class="kanji-inline">取</span>, the latter originally describing the cutting off of an enemy’s left ear to record merit; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="最.html">最</a> thus suggests a heap of gathered ears. Joined to the hand, the meaning focuses on taking something delicately with the fingertips—pinching or picking up a small amount—which underlies uses such as issatsu no tsuchi, “a pinch of soil.” By extension it also came to mean “to take” images, as in satsuei, photography.</p>
