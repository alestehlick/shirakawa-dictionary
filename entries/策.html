    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">策</span> as a phono-semantic compound: the bamboo radical signals a bamboo or wooden implement, while the phonetic element (<span class="kanji-inline">朿</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="束.html">束</a>) supplies the sound and originally depicted a long, pointed piece of wood used as a horsewhip. The Shuowen already glosses it as the lash for striking a horse, and expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">杖</span><span class="kanji-inline">策</span> evoke a whip affixed to a staff. From this concrete tool the sense broadened to the bamboo or wooden plates on which characters were written—hence <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="簡.html">簡</a><span class="kanji-inline">策</span>, “bamboo or wooden slips with writing.” Because plans were set down on such tablets, compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">策</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="謀.html">謀</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">策</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="略.html">略</a> came to mean working out, that is, writing down a stratagem. For the “tablet/writing” sense the older graph is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="冊.html">冊</a>, and royal written directives were called <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="冊.html">冊</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a>, later also written <span class="kanji-inline">策</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a>. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">策</span> ranges from the tangible “whip, cane” and “writing tablet” to the abstract “plan, policy.”</p>
