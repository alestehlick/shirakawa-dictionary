    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">邸</span> is a phono-semantic character. The phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">氐</span> (tei) originally depicts shaving a base flat with a small handled blade, and supplies the reading. As the Shuowen notes, the word first referred to a state-owned building—specifically the quarters provided in the capital for visiting feudal lords. The compound <span class="kanji-inline">邸</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="閣.html">閣</a> initially named government storehouses for grain, and the sense later broadened to a private dwelling and, by extension, a grand residence or palatial mansion (as in gotei).</p>
