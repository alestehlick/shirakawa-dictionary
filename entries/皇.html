    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Above the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="王.html">王</a>, which depicts a great ceremonial broadax set blade-down before the royal seat as a symbol of kingship, this character shows a jade ornament and the radiance streaming from it. The axe’s haft was capped with jade, and the added strokes portray the light emitted by that precious stone; hence the original sense of shining or sparkling. Because this gleaming axe-head signified royal rank, the graph also came to mean the king, the sovereign, the Son of Heaven. In later history the Qin ruler Zheng styled himself the First Emperor, Shi Huangdi, and for over two millennia the title huangdi was used in China, first evoking the deity or emperor of Heaven; in Japan the corresponding title is Tennō.</p>
