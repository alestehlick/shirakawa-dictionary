    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">勳</span>, the character later took the picto-phonetic form with <span class="kanji-inline">熏</span> as its phonetic, yielding the on reading kun. Early variants such as <span class="kanji-inline">勛</span> combine a round ding tripod (graphically akin to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="員.html">員</a>) with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a>, the plough, hinting at commendations tied to agricultural labor, sometimes rewarded with cowry money. On the Mao Gong Ding inscription, an even older form shows the act of pouring and bestowing wine with a jue ritual goblet, likely the prototype of <span class="kanji-inline">勳</span> and a vivid image of the ceremonial granting that praised achievement. Over time the concrete elements of the ding and the jue were reorganized under the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">熏</span> to form the standard character, which settled into the meaning of merit and distinguished service.</p>
