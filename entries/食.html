    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">食</span> as a pictograph of a gui (<span class="kanji-inline">簋</span>), a round ritual food vessel; with a lid set on top, the vessel’s profile becomes the form of the character. From the image of food placed in a container it naturally came to mean “food,” and by extension “to eat.” Because a person is sustained by eating, the sense further broadens to “to nourish, to provide for.” In Japanese, when it specifically denotes “food,” the on reading shi is also used. Bronze inscriptions often depict the act of eating or drinking by placing the vessel sign before a person, showing a diner with tableware set in front. In the Yin period, it is noted that two meals a day were customary.</p>
