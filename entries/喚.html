    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">喚</span> is a phono-semantic character: the mouth component marks speech or voice, while <span class="kanji-inline">奐</span> supplies the sound and originally pictured a person lifting a newborn with both hands as it emerges from an animal with thighs parted. Related expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">涣</span><span class="kanji-inline">然</span> evoke the vigor and clarity of childbirth, and <span class="kanji-inline">奎</span> likewise names the smooth delivery of a lamb, in line with the sense of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="達.html">達</a>, “to pass through,” for a birth that proceeds unimpeded. From this imagery, <span class="kanji-inline">喚</span> comes to denote the loud cry at the moment of birth, and by extension the acts of calling out and screaming.</p>
