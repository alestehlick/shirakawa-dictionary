    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">率</span> as a pictograph of wringing out a bundle of wet threads. The ancient forms show a skein pierced by small wooden bars above and below, twisted to squeeze out the water, with droplets drawn to either side. From the act of applying force and drawing everything together, the character came to mean to lead or to command. Because the water is wrung out completely, it also developed the senses of all, entirely, and in general. By extension it can carry the idea of following, as in compounds like sotsujun (obedient, compliant).</p>
