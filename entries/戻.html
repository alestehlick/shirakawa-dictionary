    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">戾</span>, the graph joins <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戸.html">戸</a> (door, threshold) with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a> (dog). In ancient practice the doorway was a vital liminal place, and a dog was buried there as a sacrificial act of exorcism to keep harmful spirits from entering. From this threshold-ritual image the character developed senses such as to run counter or oppose and also to reach or come to, and in certain contexts it could denote an offense or sin (as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="罪.html">罪</a><span class="kanji-inline">戻</span>). In Japanese it came to be used for the everyday idea of returning or restoring, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="返.html">返</a><span class="kanji-inline">戻</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="元.html">元</a>に<span class="kanji-inline">戻</span>す, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="後.html">後</a><span class="kanji-inline">戻</span>り.</p>
