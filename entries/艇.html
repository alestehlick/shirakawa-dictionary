    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed from <span class="kanji-inline">舟</span>, “boat,” with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="廷.html">廷</a> as the phonetic element marking the on-reading tei. The sense inherent in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="廷.html">廷</a>—straight or upright—suggests a long, narrow hull, guiding the image toward a slender boat. Later glosses, such as those in the Shuowen’s New Appendices, define it as a small boat, like a dugout or skiff for one or two people. Accordingly, the character came to designate small-sized boats and light craft, as reflected in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">舟</span><span class="kanji-inline">艇</span> (boats, craft), <span class="kanji-inline">艇</span><span class="kanji-inline">庫</span> (boathouse), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="競.html">競</a><span class="kanji-inline">艇</span> (motorboat racing).</p>
