    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">典</span> brings together <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="冊.html">冊</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">册</span>), the bundled slips of bamboo or wood used as early books, and <span class="kanji-inline">丌</span>, a stand. In early forms <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="冊.html">冊</a> even resembles a small fence (<span class="kanji-inline">柵</span>), evoking the closely set, laced slats of those tablets. The character thus pictures a written volume set upon a stand, and so first means a book or writing. Because the writings of antiquity were honored as standards to emulate, the sense naturally extends to taking something as a model, and by further development to law and code.</p>
