    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character originally appears as <span class="kanji-inline">戰</span>, formed by combining <span class="kanji-inline">單</span>, the image of an oval shield topped with two plume-like decorations, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>, a halberd. In bronze inscriptions one can even see a figure defending with a shield in the right hand and striking with a pike in the left, a vivid emblem of combat. From this composition the senses to fight, battle, and war developed. The Japanese verb tatakau probably echoes an older phrase tatekau, to cross shields. By phonetic extension with the same on reading sen, the graph is also used for the sense to tremble or shudder, standing in for <span class="kanji-inline">顫</span>, hence readings such as ononoku.</p>
