    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">詐</span> is a phono-semantic character built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, “speech,” and the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">乍</span>, read sa. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">乍</span> depicts a small tree branch forced to bend, as when making a fence—an image of human effort changing a thing’s original form. With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> added, that notion of forced change is applied to words: speech that is bent, pledges or promises that are altered, hence the senses “to deceive” and “to lie.” In the compound <span class="kanji-inline">詐</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="欺.html">欺</a> (sagi), <span class="kanji-inline">詐</span> conveys the bending of facts and false speech, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="欺.html">欺</a> evokes a large, four-cornered mask set over the face, the act of duping another.</p>
