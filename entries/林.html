    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">林</span> sets two trees side by side, picturing a place where trees grow in numbers—a grove or light forest. By contrast, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="森.html">森</a> stacks three trees to evoke a deep, luxuriant woodland once felt to be the abode of deities. The native word hayashi echoes hayasu, “to let grow,” and the character carries that sense of generative, nurturing power. In antiquity people lived near such groves, drawn to the vital force that trees were believed to bring forth and foster.</p>
