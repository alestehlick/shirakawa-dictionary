    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character now written <span class="kanji-inline">歯</span> goes back to the older form <span class="kanji-inline">齒</span>. In the earliest oracle-bone inscriptions it is a simple pictograph: the shape of teeth, with no phonetic element. Later, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a> was added as a phonetic indicator for the on reading shi, while the lower portion continued to depict the teeth themselves. Already in the Yin period a derivative, <span class="kanji-inline">齲</span> “mushiba” (dental caries), was formed by inserting the “insect” sign between the teeth, and divinations even asked, “Will the teeth become ill?” Because the age of animals can be judged by their teeth, the character also came to mean “age,” as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="年.html">年</a><span class="kanji-inline">歯</span>, and in court usage <span class="kanji-inline">歯</span><span class="kanji-inline">杖</span>, the “age cane,” was the cane presented by the emperor to those of seventy years.</p>
