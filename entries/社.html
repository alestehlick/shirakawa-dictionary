    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">社</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a>, the altar or offering table used in worship, with a right-hand element originally written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a>, a rounded clod of earth that both gives the sound and depicts the earth deity itself. In oracle-bone forms, small dots appear on this earthen mound, indicating the sprinkling of purifying liquor over the god. A yashiro, or shrine, was first the sacred place where this earth deity was revered—an open structure without a roof raised over the altar. Mountains, rivers, and clustered groves were likewise conceived as divine abodes, and trees were often planted above each region’s earth-god mound. As worship later moved into built sanctuaries, these became the jinja, Shinto shrines. From the shrine as a community center, the character’s meaning extended to organized groups, seen in words like kessha (association) and kaisha (company).</p>
