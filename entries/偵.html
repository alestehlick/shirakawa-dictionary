    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character in which <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貞.html">貞</a> (tei) supplies the sound and also carries its original sense of divinatory inquiry—seeking the gods’ will by means of a ding tripod (<span class="kanji-inline">鼎</span>). Set beside the person element, that sense of solemn questioning shifts into human affairs: to ask after and feel out someone’s movements, to probe and reconnoiter—hence the meanings of spying and scouting. Although no archaic forms of <span class="kanji-inline">偵</span> are recorded, its components clearly reveal this path of meaning.</p>
