    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">正</span> as a compound: the footstep graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a>—whose ancient form matches <span class="kanji-inline">之</span> and means to go or advance—set against the image of a walled city. In early forms it thus depicts a person moving upon a fortified place, yielding the sense of attacking and subduing. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">正</span> functioned as the original graph of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="征.html">征</a>, “to campaign and conquer,” while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="政.html">政</a> named the method of rule over the subdued—exerting strong pressure and exacting levies. Order imposed in this way was regarded as proper and just (<span class="kanji-inline">正</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="当.html">当</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">正</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="義.html">義</a>), and from that valuation the character came to mean “correct” and “to rectify,” as reflected also in compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="純.html">純</a><span class="kanji-inline">正</span>, “pure, unmixed.”</p>
