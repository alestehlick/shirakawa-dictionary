    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">當</span>, this is a phono‑semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尚.html">尚</a> as its sound element; related graphs such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="堂.html">堂</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">棠</span> also use <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尚.html">尚</a>. Classical passages in the Xunzi show <span class="kanji-inline">当</span> used where <span class="kanji-inline">嘗</span> appears with senses like “once” and “as a trial.” Shirakawa understands <span class="kanji-inline">嘗</span> as the welcoming of deities who come in answer to offerings and prayers, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尚.html">尚</a> as the manifestation of those gods at the window where they are received. Reading <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a> as the space between the fields, <span class="kanji-inline">當</span> evokes an agricultural rite of welcoming and worshipping the gods in the ricefield. Because such rites were performed at the proper season, the character came to express alignment with the right time—hence senses like hitting the mark, corresponding or meeting, fitting or suiting, being fulfilled, and “just now/exactly.”</p>
