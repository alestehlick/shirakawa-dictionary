    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character built on the graph <span class="kanji-inline">臤</span>, which supplies the on reading ken. <span class="kanji-inline">臤</span> is formed by inserting the hand <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a> into <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="臣.html">臣</a>, the eye turned upward with a large pupil that, in Shirakawa’s view, depicts one who serves the gods after the light of the eyes has been taken. The hand intruding into the eye conveys the act of injuring the pupil, evoking a mind under strain and a body drawn tight. Placed over the earth sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a>, this image is transferred to the ground itself—soil compacted and resistant—giving <span class="kanji-inline">堅</span> the sense of hardness and firmness.</p>
