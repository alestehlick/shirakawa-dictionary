    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">押</span> is a phono-semantic character: the hand radical signals an action performed with the hand, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="甲.html">甲</a> serves as the phonetic element. Shirakawa notes that <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="甲.html">甲</a> also carries the sense found in <span class="kanji-inline">柙</span>, a “cage,” evoking the idea of enclosing or confining, which suits the notion of pressing or holding something down. The character was once read with the on reading kō by direct association with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="甲.html">甲</a>, but later settled on ō, as seen in parallels like the on reading of <span class="kanji-inline">鴨</span>. In usage, it expresses carrying something through by force, applying pressure, pushing, and restraining—hence the verbs osu and osaeru.</p>
