    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">絵</span> is a phono-semantic character. In its traditional form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="繪.html">繪</a>, the silk-thread element signals textiles, while <span class="kanji-inline">會</span> serves as the phonetic. Shirakawa notes that <span class="kanji-inline">會</span> originally pictured a vessel in which various foods were gathered together, an image of mixing and assembling; carried into <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="繪.html">繪</a>, it suggests bringing many colors together. Thus the character first referred to richly colored woven patterns and textile designs, and only later broadened to mean a pictorial image and the act of drawing. The Analects already speak of painting practice—“when painting, the white (<span class="kanji-inline">素</span>) comes at the end”—a reminder that the art of finishing with color was early and well understood.</p>
