    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character. The old form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="北.html">北</a> depicts two people set back to back, one facing right and the other left—an image that naturally yielded the sense of the back. When <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="北.html">北</a> later specialized as the directional “north,” the flesh element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> (nikuzuki), marking a body part, was added to create <span class="kanji-inline">背</span> and anchor the meaning as “back, backside.” <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="北.html">北</a> also serves as the phonetic, as seen in the place-name graph <span class="kanji-inline">邶</span>, and it gives <span class="kanji-inline">背</span> the on reading hai. From the scene of turning one’s back arose extended senses such as to turn away, oppose, or betray. In Japanese usage it also points to stature (se, sei), as in setake and seikurabe.</p>
