    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">柔</span> is a compound graph combining an element written like <span class="kanji-inline">矛</span> above <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>. In early bronze texts a related form, <span class="kanji-inline">謖</span>—built from <span class="kanji-inline">卣</span>, a wine vessel, and the figure of a dancer—depicted offering wine and dancing before the deities, and from that ritual scene took on the sense of appeasing and softening the divine will. Because the on-readings were close, <span class="kanji-inline">柔</span> came to be used for that meaning and the older graph receded. In <span class="kanji-inline">柔</span> itself, the upper element, though shaped like <span class="kanji-inline">矛</span>, already suggests a bent bough; together with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> it evokes a pliant, bending tree. From the idea of soothing the gods grew the senses “to set at ease, to pacify,” and, more broadly, “soft” and “gentle.”</p>
