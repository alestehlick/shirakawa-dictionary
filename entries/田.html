    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of a field divided into plots. In oracle-bone script a single plot is drawn as a rectangle, while in bronze inscriptions it settles into a neat square. Bronze evidence suggests <span class="kanji-inline">田</span> denoted roughly the area a single man could cultivate, hence its core sense of “field” and, by extension, “to till a paddy field.” In the oracle inscriptions, however, it often stands for “hunting, chase,” a usage still found in the Book of Odes and the Book of Documents; later, that hunting sense came to be written with <span class="kanji-inline">畋</span>.</p>
