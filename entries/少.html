    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">少</span> as a pictograph: small shells threaded onto a cord. The earlier graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="小.html">小</a> shows the shells scattered, while <span class="kanji-inline">少</span> depicts them gathered on a string; the line for the cord is not an independent character but part of the picture. Because only a small number of shells are strung, the character comes to mean “few” and “a little,” and by extension, when applied to people, “young.”</p>
