    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, this character is a pictograph of a small knife with a handle. It evokes the ritual knife used to carve and share the meat of a sacrifice at the communal meal following ancestor worship. Because this act of dividing and sharing the offering bound the group together, the knife became the emblem of the kin group, and <span class="kanji-inline">氏</span> came to denote those who partook in that common meal—in other words, the clan. Just as a king at state rites cut the sacrificial meat with a decorated rantō, a bell-adorned knife, the head of the clan carried out this role at clan ceremonies. Ancestor worship followed by the shared feast was central to sustaining the clan order, and from this ritual focus the graph acquired the sense ‘uji, family clan.’</p>
