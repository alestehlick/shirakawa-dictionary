    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">億</span> is a phonetic compound that takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="意.html">意</a> as its phonetic core, a pattern it shares with <span class="kanji-inline">臆</span>. Shirakawa explains <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="意.html">意</a> as formed from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="音.html">音</a> “sound” and <span class="kanji-inline">心</span> “heart,” expressing how the gods give a faint sound in response to prayer—a divine message that the heart must interpret. Thus <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="意.html">意</a> denotes the act of hearing, weighing, and pondering the will of the gods. In earlier usage, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="意.html">意</a> itself could stand for the senses later written with <span class="kanji-inline">億</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">憶</span> (“to think; to fathom”). Over time, <span class="kanji-inline">億</span> shifted away from that sphere of thought and conjecture and came to serve as a numerical term meaning “a hundred million.”</p>
