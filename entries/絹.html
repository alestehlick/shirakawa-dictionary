    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the silk-thread sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a> provides the sense of textiles, while the phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">肙</span> guides the on-reading ken and appears in kindred graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">涓</span> (“drops”) and others meaning an earthen chamber. The Shuowen glosses it as resembling the color of a wheat stem, so <span class="kanji-inline">絹</span> originally evoked the pale, lustrous yellow of silk and by extension came to mean silk itself. Early graphic forms even echo the source of the material, resembling a silkworm with its mouth open as if extruding thread; tortoise plastron and bone inscriptions depict a silkworm on a mulberry leaf, showing that by the Yin (Shang) period, several millennia ago, sericulture was already practiced and silk was being produced—an indigenous achievement of East Asia.</p>
