    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">廳</span>, built with <span class="kanji-inline">聽</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="聴.html">聴</a>) as its phonetic. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="聴.html">聴</a> evokes wise, inspired listening—the attentiveness that can catch the voices of the deities—so <span class="kanji-inline">廳</span> came to designate the place where matters were listened to and adjudicated: the government office that conducted hearings and judged lawsuits. Classical glosses also extend it to the reception hall or drawing room (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="客.html">客</a><span class="kanji-inline">廳</span>), a space for receiving guests. The modern form <span class="kanji-inline">庁</span> preserves this sense of a public hall and administrative office.</p>
