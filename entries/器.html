    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph: in its earliest form, <span class="kanji-inline">器</span> depicts four <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> signs—ritual receptacles for covenant texts—arranged around a <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a>, a dog offered as a purifying sacrifice. The picture thus signifies vessels purified for ceremonial use, and the word first referred to ritual and funerary vessels. From this it broadened to mean tools and instruments, and by extension a person’s capacity or ability. In later standard forms the central <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a> was replaced by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>, the figure of a person with outstretched limbs.</p>
