    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of a dog, drawn as a sturdy, powerful animal—likely the hunting dogs of antiquity. In Yin and Zhou royal tombs, dogs were interred as sacrifices, sometimes alongside soldiers, to guard the king; rites called Fuku (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="伏.html">伏</a>) and Fuku-ei (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="伏.html">伏</a><span class="kanji-inline">瘞</span>) buried a person with a dog to pin down baleful spirits hidden in the earth. In the Warring States period, cherished dogs were even buried with gold and silver ornaments, and the dog sacrifice was regarded as especially noble. In high ritual for worshipping the supreme deity in heaven, grain was offered and a sacrificial dog was burned so that its fragrance rose skyward; purification with a dog also consecrated new buildings and newly made vessels. This consecratory role of <span class="kanji-inline">犬</span> is preserved in several graphs: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="就.html">就</a> marks the use of a sacrificial dog at the completion of a fortress gate (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="京.html">京</a>); <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="器.html">器</a> a vessel purified by such a dog; <span class="kanji-inline">獻</span> a tripod-like offering vessel purified in this way; and <span class="kanji-inline">猷</span> a plan in which a dog is added to fragrant wine (<span class="kanji-inline">酋</span>) to seek the gods’ will. A puppy is <span class="kanji-inline">狗</span>, just as a foal is <span class="kanji-inline">駒</span>. In later standardized forms (for example, in characters like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="類.html">類</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="器.html">器</a>), the <span class="kanji-inline">犬</span> element was sometimes replaced by the human-shaped <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>, and the original ritual nuance was lost.</p>
