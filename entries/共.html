    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">共</span> goes back to a figure of two hands set side by side, built on the hand-sign <span class="kanji-inline">廾</span>, showing both hands holding up various offerings. In early forms it depicts those hands respectfully raising a ritual implement used in divine ceremonies, an image that gives the character a tone of reverent restraint and deference—senses that later nourish the character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="恭.html">恭</a>. From the fact that the act is performed with left and right hands together, the meaning “together, in common” naturally arises. The same two-handed offering stance also stands behind <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="供.html">供</a>, “to offer, to provide.”</p>
