    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character. In the oldest inscriptions the graph appears as <span class="kanji-inline">埜</span>, showing a wooded area with a shrine; here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a> is the early graph used for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="社.html">社</a>, the sacred place of worship. The form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="里.html">里</a> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a> (fields) with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a> to depict a field precinct centered on a shrine where the field gods were venerated. By adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="予.html">予</a> as a phonetic element to this base, the character <span class="kanji-inline">野</span> is formed. Originally it evoked a sacred grove or cultivated precinct at the outskirts, and its meaning later broadened to the open country—fields and countryside—and by extension the rustic or vulgar.</p>
