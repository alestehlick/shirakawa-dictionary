    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">庸</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">庚</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="用.html">用</a>. He sees <span class="kanji-inline">庚</span> as the figure of a person grasping a pestle, the tool used to pound, thrash, and polish grain, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="用.html">用</a> depicts a wooden palisade or frame. Brought together, they evoke packing earth into that wooden frame and tamping it firm with the pestle to form a solid wall or rampart—hence the original sense “fence.” The graph later came to be employed in place of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="用.html">用</a> and so also acquired the meaning “to use.” To represent the older sense explicitly, <span class="kanji-inline">墉</span> was created by adding the earth element. In subsequent usage, <span class="kanji-inline">庸</span> broadened further to mean “usual, common,” “average,” and even “stupid.”</p>
