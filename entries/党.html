    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">黨</span>, this is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">尚</span> as the sound element—the same phonetic that appears in <span class="kanji-inline">當</span> (tō) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="堂.html">堂</a> (dō). In ancient imagery, <span class="kanji-inline">尚</span> suggests the faint manifestation of a divine sign at a window prepared to welcome and worship the gods, while <span class="kanji-inline">黑</span> evokes the soot-blackened color of the cooking stove. Together they picture inviting the deities at the window above the hearth, and by extension the people who cook, eat, and celebrate together: companions sharing one stove. From this sense of fellows of a single hearth arose meanings such as one’s kin or clan (yakara), and later a territorial or political grouping—a party or faction.</p>
