    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">宣</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span>, the roof of a sacred hall or mausoleum where ancestral spirits were revered, with <span class="kanji-inline">亘</span>, a graph that often evokes a semicircular span. In early usage, <span class="kanji-inline">宣</span> named the senshitsu, the semicircular pre-chamber of the palace, a space for hearings, trials, and solemn rites. Bronze inscriptions such as the Guoji Zibai Pan record executions of the Xianyun and the<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="献.html">献</a><span class="kanji-inline">馘</span> rite of presenting an enemy commander’s head performed in this chamber. Because pronouncements issued from there, the character took on the sense of publicly proclaiming or making known; in Japanese it yields noberu “to state” and notamau “to say” (honorific), and later also came to mean “clear, manifest.”</p>
