    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph formed from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a> portrays a miko, a female shaman, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> represents the sai, a ritual receptacle into which covenant writings and prayers to the gods were placed. In the ancient image, the shamaness chants and seeks the deity’s will, receives the oracle, and conveys it. From this sense of aligning oneself with the revealed intention arises the meaning “as, like,” the desire to be in harmony with that will; the Japanese readings gotoshi and shiku evoke matching or becoming equal—drawing near to the divine pattern. Its structure is akin to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="若.html">若</a>.</p>
