    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph of a ladle (shaku) holding contents, capturing the act of scooping out a measured amount. From that image it came to name both the measuring vessel itself and a fixed measure of capacity; in Japan it denotes the shō, equal to ten gō (about 1.8 liters). Its use with the sense “to rise” reflects its function as the phonetic element in the characters <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="昇.html">昇</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">陞</span>, with which it shares meaning. In older expressions it can also mean to present offerings, and by extension appears in phrases about the grains ‘bearing’—that is, coming to ripen and yield a crop.</p>
