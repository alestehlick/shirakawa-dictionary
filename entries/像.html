    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">像</span> is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">象</span> serving as the phonetic, which gives the on reading zō. The Shuowen defines it as “to resemble” and notes that it is read like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="養.html">養</a> (yo) in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="養.html">養</a><span class="kanji-inline">子</span>, suggesting yo as an older on reading. Because <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="養.html">養</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="様.html">様</a> share that yo reading, the character naturally extended to denote outward appearance and state—form, model, figure—hence its senses of image, likeness, and the shaped figure.</p>
