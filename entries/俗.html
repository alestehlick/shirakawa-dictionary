    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the person radical <span class="kanji-inline">亻</span> points to people and social life, while <span class="kanji-inline">谷</span> serves as the phonetic element—not the “koku” of ravines, but the value heard in <span class="kanji-inline">容</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">欲</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">浴</span>. In <span class="kanji-inline">容</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">谷</span> depicts a covenant vessel set within the ancestral shrine, over which the numinous presence of the gods is sensed; <span class="kanji-inline">欲</span> originally voiced the wish to behold that epiphany. In bronze inscriptions <span class="kanji-inline">俗</span> is even used with the sense of <span class="kanji-inline">欲</span>, showing their closeness. From this ritual background, <span class="kanji-inline">俗</span> came to denote the shared norms shaped by communal belief—the customary etiquette and ways of society—and by extension what is ordinary, worldly, and at times vulgar.</p>
