    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the hand on the left signals a manual act, while the right-side bird graph (<span class="kanji-inline">隹</span>) supplies the on-reading sui and evokes bird augury. That bird element, seen also in characters like <span class="kanji-inline">惟</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="進.html">進</a>, and <span class="kanji-inline">誰</span>, belonged to the sphere of divination, and <span class="kanji-inline">推</span> likely arose in that context as the act of drawing conclusions from signs—hence meanings such as ‘to infer’ or ‘to suppose.’ From this core idea the sense expanded to ‘pushing things forward,’ that is, advancing or promoting a matter. A celebrated Tang anecdote further anchored the character in literary culture: the poet Jia Dao vacillated between writing <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="僧.html">僧</a><span class="kanji-inline">推</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="下.html">下</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a> (‘the monk pushes the gate under the moon’) and replacing <span class="kanji-inline">推</span> with <span class="kanji-inline">敲</span> ‘knock’; this scrupulous choice gave rise to the idiom <span class="kanji-inline">推</span><span class="kanji-inline">敲</span>, now meaning to polish and refine one’s writing.</p>
