    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the ancient script, <span class="kanji-inline">愛</span> combines the figure of <span class="kanji-inline">爰</span>—a person pausing and looking back—with a <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a> placed at the chest. It pictures someone whose heart is tugged backward at the moment of parting, a feeling that gives rise to “love” and tender care. In Japanese it was also read kanashi, evoking the sorrow of leaving one’s heart with those who remain and the weight that lingers on the mind. From this core sense the character came to mean love and affection more broadly; related graphs written with the same sound, such as <span class="kanji-inline">曖</span>, describe dim or clouded states (as in aimai, “ambiguity”), extending the idea into feelings and scenes softened by shadow.</p>
