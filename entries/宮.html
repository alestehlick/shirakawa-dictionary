    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">宮</span> combines the roof radical with <span class="kanji-inline">呂</span>, which originally sketched a plan of paired rooms front and back, evoking a sizeable roofed complex. In early usage it denoted the palace mausoleum—a sanctuary for venerating ancestral spirits. In some bronze-inscription forms a <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="九.html">九</a> sign is added; its sinuous, dragon-like shape marks the building as sacred and suggests a place for exorcistic rites. From this sacral precinct the sense broadened to the king’s residence (the royal palace) and, by extension, a dwelling or shrine.</p>
