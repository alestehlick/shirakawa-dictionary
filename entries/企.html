    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, this character is a pictograph: a human figure seen from the side with the graph <span class="kanji-inline">止</span>, the footprint or leg, added below. Together they show someone lifting the head and rising onto tiptoe to look into the distance. From that poised, expectant posture came the senses “to stand on tiptoe” and “to gaze ahead with desire,” and, by extension, the act of devising or intending—making a plan. This nuance also resonates with older Japanese usage: kuwa, “heel,” gives kuwatatsu, “to raise the heels,” which underlies kuwadateru, “to plan.” The same trajectory of meaning runs from <span class="kanji-inline">企</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="立.html">立</a> (kiritsu, standing with lifted heels) to <span class="kanji-inline">企</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="画.html">画</a> (kikaku, drawing up a plan).</p>
