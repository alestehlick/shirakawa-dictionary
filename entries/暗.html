    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">暗</span> as a phono-semantic character in the <span class="kanji-inline">音</span> series, with <span class="kanji-inline">音</span> supplying the on reading an. Its older expression is <span class="kanji-inline">闇</span>, which shows a sound issuing within the double doors <span class="kanji-inline">門</span> of a household shrine. Petitionary writings (<span class="kanji-inline">言</span>)—a graph formed from <span class="kanji-inline">辛</span>, the tattooing needle of oath-punishment, and a receptacle for the covenant text—were placed before the gods and vows were made. In the night the vessel holding these writings emitted a sound that revealed the deities’ response; that answering sound is what <span class="kanji-inline">音</span> depicts. <span class="kanji-inline">闇</span> thus conveys the experience of hearing the nocturnal visitation of the gods at the shrine, and from those indistinct night sounds both <span class="kanji-inline">闇</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">暗</span> came to denote “dark” and “darkness.”</p>
