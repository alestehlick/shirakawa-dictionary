    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">暗</span> is a phono-semantic graph with <span class="kanji-inline">音</span> as its phonetic. Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">音</span> not as a mere “sound,” but as the answering sound of a covenant vessel used in shrine divination. He traces the idea back to the related graph <span class="kanji-inline">闇</span>, which depicts a sound heard within the double-leaf doors <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a> of a small household shrine. Written prayers (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>) were placed there to question the gods; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> itself combines a tattooing needle <span class="kanji-inline">辛</span> with a receptacle, expressing a solemn pledge to accept punishment if one misreports the divine message. At night, the vessel holding these prayer slips was believed to give forth a sound, signaling the deity’s will—this answering sound is what the ancient bronze forms of <span class="kanji-inline">音</span> show. <span class="kanji-inline">闇</span> thus evokes hearing the gods’ nocturnal visit at the shrine doors, and from this notion of indistinct, night-time sounds through which the divine intimates its will, <span class="kanji-inline">暗</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">闇</span> came to signify “dark” and “darkness.”</p>
