    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">燃</span> is a phono-semantic character formed by adding an extra fire component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="火.html">火</a> to <span class="kanji-inline">然</span> in order to express the act of burning. In its ancient form, <span class="kanji-inline">然</span> depicts the broiling of a sacrificial dog’s flesh, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> standing for meat (an abbreviation of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肉.html">肉</a>), and it originally meant “to burn.” As <span class="kanji-inline">然</span> later came to serve as a conjunction meaning “however,” the explicit sense of burning was carried by the newly made <span class="kanji-inline">燃</span>. Here <span class="kanji-inline">然</span> provides the sound value (On reading nen; compare <span class="kanji-inline">撚</span>, also read nen, meaning “to twist” or “to become entangled”), while the added fire emphasizes combustion. From the Han period onward, <span class="kanji-inline">燃</span> was used for “to burn” and “to set on fire.”</p>
