    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">燃</span> combines the fire radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="火.html">火</a> with <span class="kanji-inline">然</span>. In <span class="kanji-inline">然</span>, the elements <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> (an abbreviated form of flesh) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a> depict dog meat set out as a sacrificial offering; with fire applied, it shows the meat being roasted so that its fragrance rises to the heavens. In ancient rites, dogs and rice were offered to the supreme deity, and the pleasing aroma of the roasting was sent upward in prayer. From this base, <span class="kanji-inline">然</span> later came to be used phonetically for adverbial senses like “thus” and “however,” while the form with the added fire was fixed for the concrete sense of “to burn,” “to roast,” or “to broil.” In this way, <span class="kanji-inline">燃</span> expresses burning in the physical, combustible sense.</p>
