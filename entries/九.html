    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">九</span> as a pictograph drawn from the dragon. In early forms of the dragon graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="竜.html">竜</a>, the element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="虫.html">虫</a> (here not meaning ‘insect’) represents the body, while <span class="kanji-inline">九</span> depicts the bent, severed head—understood as a male dragon’s head. The ancient graph <span class="kanji-inline">禹</span>, name of the flood-taming deity, combines this male-dragon head with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="虫.html">虫</a> to portray a dragon being. The use of <span class="kanji-inline">九</span> for the numeral ‘nine’ is a later phonetic borrowing. In Japanese, kokonotsu evokes the point at which counting on the fingers comes to its end. In China, nine was revered as a sacred number—reflected in titles like the Nine Songs and Nine Chapters—so <span class="kanji-inline">九</span> likely carried an aura of sanctity.</p>
