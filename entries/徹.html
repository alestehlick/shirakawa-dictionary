    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: its phonetic element marks the on-reading tetsu, while early forms show a hand (te/yu) lifting a reki, a narrow-necked tripod kettle (<span class="kanji-inline">鬲</span>). In ritual, after worship the kettles were set out in orderly rows for the banquet; <span class="kanji-inline">徹</span> originally named the completion of that setting-out—arranging and finishing the display. By contrast, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="撤.html">撤</a> denotes withdrawing the kettles. From the idea of carrying something through to the end, the meaning broadened to go through, penetrate, and thoroughly pervade.</p>
