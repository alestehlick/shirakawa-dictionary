    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The ancient form depicts a piece of wood fitted into a square frame, the bar set across a gateway to halt passage—essentially a gate bolt. It is thus the original graph of the “gate-bolt” character <span class="kanji-inline">闔</span>. In Yanzi Chunqiu (Miscellany, first part), the phrase <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="井.html">井</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="里.html">里</a>の<span class="kanji-inline">困</span> refers to the village gate that controlled entry and exit, underscoring how strictly such gates were secured. From the image of barring a gate and prohibiting movement, the sense broadened to being hemmed in with no advance or retreat, and eventually to the general meanings “to be troubled” and “to suffer.”</p>
