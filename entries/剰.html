    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats <span class="kanji-inline">剰</span> as a later phono-semantic graph, originally written <span class="kanji-inline">剩</span>, with <span class="kanji-inline">乘</span> (modern <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="乗.html">乗</a>) providing the sound value jo. He connects it to <span class="kanji-inline">賸</span>, whose composition portrays an offering: a shallow tray (the element written <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> here is taken as the form of a tray or vessel) bearing shell money <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>, held up with both hands. From this scene arise the senses of presenting or giving, and by extension what is left as a remainder. In use, <span class="kanji-inline">剰</span> expresses “to be left over,” and in adverbial form <span class="kanji-inline">剰</span>え (amatsusae) conveys “what is more; besides.”</p>
