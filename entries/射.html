    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the oldest forms, this character brings together a bow (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="弓.html">弓</a>), an arrow (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="矢.html">矢</a>), and a hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>), vividly depicting the act of nocking an arrow and letting it fly. From this concrete scene it comes to mean “to shoot.” In later script the graph was written with <span class="kanji-inline">身</span> over <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a>, but the underlying image is the original bow–arrow–hand composition. Because arrows were regarded as sacred, drawing the bow and shooting was performed as a solemn rite to exorcize and purify a place; in later times the verb naturally extended to the discharge of firearms as well.</p>
