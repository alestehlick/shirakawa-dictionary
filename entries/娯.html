    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">娯</span> is a phono-semantic character formed with <span class="kanji-inline">女</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="呉.html">呉</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">吳</span>) as its phonetic. In ancient forms, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="呉.html">呉</a> depicts a person holding a ritual vessel that contained written petitions to the deity, dancing and praying to delight the gods so that requests would be granted. The <span class="kanji-inline">女</span> element evokes the woman—likely a shaman—who officiated such rites. Inheriting the sense of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="呉.html">呉</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">娯</span> came to mean enjoying, pleasing, and delighting.</p>
