    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">漁</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water element sets the scene, while the fish component serves as the phonetic (gyo). Ancient forms vividly portray the act of taking fish—some show a fish seized by the hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>), others add a net (<span class="kanji-inline">罔</span>) with a hand to indicate net-fishing, and another variant places fish in water (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="水.html">水</a>) grasped with both hands. From these images comes the meaning sunadoru: to fish, to gather fish and shellfish. Early Zhou bronze inscriptions record the offering of fish in ancestral temples, a practice also celebrated in the Book of Odes; at times even the king went out by boat to fish for that ritual purpose.</p>
