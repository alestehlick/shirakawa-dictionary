    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">植</span> as a phono-semantic compound. The tree element points to the act of planting, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="直.html">直</a> supplies both the sound and a key nuance. He analyzes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="直.html">直</a> as a graph formed from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="省.html">省</a>—an eye with an added ornament, symbolizing official inspection of the provinces to rectify wrongs—together with a component meaning “hidden,” conveying clandestine investigation and the straightening out of injustice. From this comes the sense “straight, correct.” In <span class="kanji-inline">植</span>, that uprightness is applied to the image of setting a sapling straight in the ground, yielding the meanings “to plant” and “to set up.” The phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="直.html">直</a> also underlies the on reading shoku, as seen in related graphs like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="殖.html">殖</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">埴</span>, and the character later extends in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">植</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="物.html">物</a> for plants.</p>
