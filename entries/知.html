    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="矢.html">矢</a>, an arrow revered as a sacred token of oath-taking, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> not as a mouth but as the ritual sai, a vessel that held written prayers offered to the gods. In ancient rites one swore upon the arrow—sometimes even breaking it as a pledge—and placed the covenant text in the vessel. From this image of a solemn vow made before the deities arose the sense of knowing with clarity: to know, to be enlightened. By extension it also came to mean to preside or govern, as in matsurigoto o shiran to su. The older counterpart <span class="kanji-inline">智</span> adds <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="干.html">干</a>, a shield—another sacred implement—further highlighting the ritual context; accordingly, <span class="kanji-inline">智</span> is used for nominal notions like wisdom and knowledge, while <span class="kanji-inline">知</span> expresses the verbal idea of knowing.</p>
