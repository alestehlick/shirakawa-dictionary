    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">習</span> is a compound graph with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羽.html">羽</a>, “feather,” above and, in its earliest forms, not the later <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="白.html">白</a> “white,” but the shape of a sacred receptacle that held covenant or prayer texts. The core act is to rub a feather over this container to activate and amplify the efficacy of the prayer. By its very nature this was something performed again and again, and from that repeated ritual the character came to express repetition and, by extension, learning through practice, becoming accustomed, and the piling up of actions that form habit and custom. Although later views treated the lower element as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="白.html">白</a> and glossed the whole as “to fly often,” the oracle and bronze forms preserve the vessel beneath <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羽.html">羽</a>. Feathers themselves were potent ritual objects and decorations, even affixed to arms and shields; the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="単.html">単</a> depicts two feather ornaments on an oval shield, echoing this ritual-ornamental context in which <span class="kanji-inline">習</span> took shape.</p>
