    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">年</span> as a compound of the rice plant sign <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span> and a person. In ancient ritual imagery, <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span> appears as a headdress symbolizing the indwelling rice spirit, while the human figure is a man performing a field dance at planting time to pray for abundance. From this scene arises the sense of minori, the ripened fruit or harvest, and because rice bears once per cycle, the graph naturally came to mean year. Oracle-bone inscriptions even record divinations phrased as “Will we be granted a harvest?” using <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="受.html">受</a><span class="kanji-inline">年</span>. He also notes the related form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="委.html">委</a>, depicting a woman in a lowered posture dancing gracefully with a rice-plant headdress. Man and woman together enact a prayer for a rich, auspicious year.</p>
