    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">候</span> is formed with the person radical on the left and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="侯.html">侯</a> as the phonetic on the right. In its ancient form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="侯.html">侯</a> depicts an exorcistic rite: a marquis releases an arrow beneath the eaves to purge malign forces around the dwelling, with one figure on the roof and another assisting below. From the marquis’s charge to watch the borders, investigate outside threats, and drive off evil, the idea naturally extends to inquiring, looking out, and waiting. With the person element added, <span class="kanji-inline">候</span> came to mean to inquire or keep vigil and, by extension, to wait. From the sense of observing and checking change, the year was articulated into the seventy-two kō seasonal phases, yielding words such as jikō (time of year) and kikō (climate). In Japan it also came to write the courtly verb sorō, ‘to attend, to be in service.’</p>
