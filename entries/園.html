    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">園</span> is a phono-semantic character: the enclosing frame suggests a bounded place, while the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">袁</span> (en) supplies both sound and imagery. In <span class="kanji-inline">袁</span>, Shirakawa sees the scene of a funerary send-off—a jade ornament placed at the neck of the shrouded body, with the sign <span class="kanji-inline">之</span> by the pillow to mark the soul’s departure—an idea that also underlies <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遠.html">遠</a>, “far.” With that nuance and the enclosure, <span class="kanji-inline">園</span> originally evoked the grove or shrubbery surrounding a burial ground. This is preserved in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">園</span><span class="kanji-inline">塋</span> (cemetery), <span class="kanji-inline">園</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="陵.html">陵</a> (imperial mausoleum), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="霊.html">霊</a><span class="kanji-inline">園</span> (cemetery). The related character <span class="kanji-inline">苑</span> names gently contoured parklands, and from such settings the meaning of <span class="kanji-inline">園</span> broadened to the cultivated spaces we now call “gardens” and “parks.”</p>
