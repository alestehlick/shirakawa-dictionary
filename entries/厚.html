    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines <span class="kanji-inline">厂</span>, the roofline of a mausoleum where ancestral spirits are venerated, with <span class="kanji-inline">旱</span>, here depicting perfumed wine set out as a ritual offering. Together they portray presenting offerings in the ancestral hall and reverently honoring the departed with great care. From this core sense of devoted attentiveness arose meanings of kindness, consideration, and courteous warmth toward others. Only later did the graph extend to the concrete notion of physical thickness, as in the thickness of a solid in contrast to thinness.</p>
