    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">監</span> as a compound: <span class="kanji-inline">臥</span> depicts a person with eyes cast downward, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皿.html">皿</a> is a round dish, here imagined as a water-filled bowl. Together they picture one gazing at their own image in a water basin—a water mirror—whence the sense “mirror.” From contemplating one’s reflection arose the idea of examining and considering, and <span class="kanji-inline">監</span> thus became the original graph for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鑑.html">鑑</a> (“mirror,” “to appraise/see”). In later compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">監</span><span class="kanji-inline">獄</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">監</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="禁.html">禁</a> it is also used in an abbreviated sense associated with confinement, evoking the notion of a “cage.”</p>
