    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa takes <span class="kanji-inline">盤</span> as a picto‑phonetic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="般.html">般</a> supplying the sound. In oracle-bone and tortoise-plastron forms the graph shows the act of dipping or ladling from a tub, pointing to a broad, shallow vessel; in bronze usage it denotes a metal washbasin. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">盤</span> naturally covers items like a tub or washbasin, a bowl, and a plate or dish. The phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="般.html">般</a> itself depicts striking a <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舟.html">舟</a>—here understood as the <span class="kanji-inline">盤</span> used as a sound-making implement—and appears in words such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="般.html">般</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="楽.html">楽</a>, associated with enjoyment. Because such vessels are often round, the character also extends to the sense of moving in a circle—‘to go around’ or ‘to revolve’—as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">盤</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="旋.html">旋</a>.</p>
