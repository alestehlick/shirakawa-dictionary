    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the wing element shows the original image, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="立.html">立</a> functions as the phonetic, signaling the on-reading (as it does in characters like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="位.html">位</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">昱</span>). In early forms the character was written <span class="kanji-inline">翊</span>, with the pure wing pictograph later augmented by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="立.html">立</a>; this eventually yielded the standardized form <span class="kanji-inline">翌</span>. In oracle-bone inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">翊</span> appears as the name of a ritual day, specifically the “bright day” (meijitsu) among the five Zhou state worship festivals, and from that context it came to mean the next or following day—hence “tomorrow.” Over time the graphs differentiated: <span class="kanji-inline">翊</span> came to be used (by extension of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="翼.html">翼</a>) with the sense “to assist,” while <span class="kanji-inline">翌</span> was reserved for the temporal meaning “the next day.”</p>
