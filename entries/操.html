    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">操</span> is a phono-semantic compound: the hand on the left marks an action of grasping or handling, while the phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">喿</span> on the right supplies the sound sō and the core image. In ancient forms, <span class="kanji-inline">喿</span> shows a tree hung with many mouth-shaped votive receptacles into which petitions to the gods were placed; people gathered there to pray aloud. This phonetic appears in <span class="kanji-inline">噪</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">譟</span> for noisy praying, and in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="燥.html">燥</a> for the anxious fervor of prayer. With the hand added, <span class="kanji-inline">操</span> depicts holding fast to that prayer-laden tree, controlling and steadying it while praying wholeheartedly for a wish to be fulfilled. From this comes the sense of taking in hand, handling, and skillfully manipulating, and by extension the moral sense of misao—steadfast principle and unchanging fidelity of will.</p>
