    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">今</span> is a pictograph: a jar-like vessel closed with a mushroom-shaped stopper and lid. This stoppered-lid motif also appears in the original writing of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="飲.html">飲</a>, where <span class="kanji-inline">酉</span> depicts a wine cask sealed in the same way. Although the graph first denoted the physical lid, it was later borrowed for its sound and came to write the idea of “now,” giving the familiar sense of the present, as in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">今</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="昔.html">昔</a> (past and present).</p>
