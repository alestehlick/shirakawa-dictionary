    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">藏</span>, this character is phono-semantic: <span class="kanji-inline">臧</span> supplies the sound. Shirakawa understands <span class="kanji-inline">臧</span> as built from <span class="kanji-inline">臣</span>, a person serving the gods, and <span class="kanji-inline">戕</span>, a ritual pike used in purification, lending an auspicious sense of “all right, proper” along with the reading. The <span class="kanji-inline">艸</span> “grass” in <span class="kanji-inline">藏</span> conjures the image of a person or goods hidden among grasses, which underlies its oldest literary use “to conceal.” From that image it naturally broadened to “to save up” and, by extension, “storehouse.”</p>
