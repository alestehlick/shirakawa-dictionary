    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">泌</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water radical (<span class="kanji-inline">氵</span>) sets the realm of liquids, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="必.html">必</a> functions as the phonetic, pointing to the on readings hitsu and hi. The Shuowen describes its core image as a narrow flow—water rushing swiftly through a constricted channel, evocative of the sound of liquid forced through a tight passage. From this image it came to be used for bodily fluids that are produced and discharged, as seen in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="分.html">分</a><span class="kanji-inline">泌</span> (secretion) and <span class="kanji-inline">泌</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尿.html">尿</a><span class="kanji-inline">器</span> (the urinary organs).</p>
