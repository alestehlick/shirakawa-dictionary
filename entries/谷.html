    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character depicts the place where a valley opens. The upper strokes <span class="kanji-inline">八</span> suggest mountain ridges piled up in front, while the lower part is not a “mouth” but an entry-like form, marking the gap that becomes the valley’s threshold. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions it even shows a ㅂ-shaped receptacle (sai) set at the valley entrance, into which petitions to the deities were placed—an indication that such places, like the sources of streams, were revered as sacred. From this image of a consecrated gateway into the mountains, the graph came to mean simply “valley.”</p>
