    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character whose older form is <span class="kanji-inline">擊</span>, with a phonetic element indicating the on-reading geki. At its core is the form <span class="kanji-inline">轂</span>, which Shirakawa explains as depicting a sack (<span class="kanji-inline">橐</span>) tied at the mouth and struck with a pike-like cudgel (<span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>). After the husks are loosened, grain is stuffed into the hanging bag and threshed by beating it; from this scene the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="穀.html">穀</a> arose with the sense of striking the contents of a sack. When the hand radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="手.html">手</a> was added below, the action of striking became overt, yielding <span class="kanji-inline">擊</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">撃</span>. The meaning then broadened from beating a suspended bag to striking in general, and by extension to slaying, attacking, and fighting. The idea of a sack hung up and left to dangle is further suggested by the element written <span class="kanji-inline">繫</span>.</p>
