    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">弟</span> began as a pictograph of something bound with a leather cord, expressing the act of tying things neatly and in proper order. The Shuowen glosses it as “to bind well in orderly fashion,” hence its early senses of order and sequence. In antiquity this character also stood where <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="第.html">第</a> was later used; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="第.html">第</a> itself pictures bamboo slips (chokkan) tied together in correct sequence. From this idea of arranging things in order, the meaning naturally extended to family ranking among children, and so it came to denote the younger brother.</p>
