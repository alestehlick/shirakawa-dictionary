    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">丹</span> is a pictograph of cinnabar being drawn up from a vertical shaft like a well. Cinnabar-bearing red clay was thought to rise through openings in the earth, forming straight, vertical veins that were mined by digging such shafts; the character portrays that substance gathered within a well. From this it came to mean cinnabar and, by extension, red. In China, techniques for extracting mercury and red pigment from cinnabar flourished and gave rise to alchemical practices (ren-dan arts), and many medicinal names include <span class="kanji-inline">丹</span>, reflecting the belief that cinnabar could lengthen life. The graph appears in <span class="kanji-inline">丹</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="青.html">青</a> for the red and blue pigments of painting, and it also came to suggest wholehearted sincerity and painstaking care, as felt in words like <span class="kanji-inline">丹</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="誠.html">誠</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">丹</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="精.html">精</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">丹</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a>, and <span class="kanji-inline">丹</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="念.html">念</a>.</p>
