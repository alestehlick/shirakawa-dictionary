    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">宙</span> is a phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="由.html">由</a> as its phonetic. The graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="由.html">由</a> originally depicts a gourd whose seeds have ripened and dissolved, leaving a hollow interior—an image of emptiness and breadth that suits the idea of a vast expanse. The <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span> at the top is the roof of an ancestral mausoleum, a form shared with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="宇.html">宇</a>, and it evokes the overarching vault. Early sources describe <span class="kanji-inline">宙</span> as the furthest reach where the limits of land and water spread out, an open, ultimate expanse. While the Huainanzi contrasts <span class="kanji-inline">宙</span> (time from antiquity to the present) with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="宇.html">宇</a> (space in the four quarters and above–below), the shared roof form shows that <span class="kanji-inline">宙</span> originally also named spaciousness. Hence its use for what is broad and boundless, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="宇.html">宇</a><span class="kanji-inline">宙</span>—“the endless space that surrounds us and all the heavenly bodies.”</p>
