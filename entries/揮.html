    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">揮</span> is a phono-semantic character: the hand radical signals an action of the hand, while <span class="kanji-inline">軍</span> serves as the phonetic, giving the on-reading ki. In early script, <span class="kanji-inline">軍</span> shows a flag streaming from a vehicle—a banner waved to muster troops—so <span class="kanji-inline">揮</span> originally evoked the hand wielding such a flag. In that martial context, <span class="kanji-inline">発</span>(<span class="kanji-inline">發</span>) meant shooting arrows at the outset of battle to announce an attack, and <span class="kanji-inline">揮</span> was the waving of the flag to mobilize; both were terms of military signaling. The sense later broadened to shaking, wielding, or moving the hands, and by extension to ‘display,’ as in <span class="kanji-inline">発</span><span class="kanji-inline">揮</span> ‘to bring out, to demonstrate.’ The same phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">軍</span> also appears in <span class="kanji-inline">暉</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">輝</span>, which share the reading ki. In literary usage, <span class="kanji-inline">揮</span><span class="kanji-inline">毫</span> names the elegant act of wielding the brush to write or paint.</p>
