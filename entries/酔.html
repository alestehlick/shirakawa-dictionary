    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">醉</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: <span class="kanji-inline">酉</span> depicts a wine vessel, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="卒.html">卒</a> acts as the phonetic that gives the on reading sui and, in this series, often carries a sense of things scattering or losing cohesion (as seen in characters like <span class="kanji-inline">碎</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">蔡</span>). Placed beside the wine jar, that nuance captures the loosening of composure brought on by alcohol, hence the meaning to get drunk. By extension, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a><span class="kanji-inline">酔</span>, it came to describe being wholly absorbed or fascinated, even indulging oneself in deep admiration.</p>
