    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of the eye. In early script the eye was drawn broad and horizontal; in the modern form it has become taller and vertical. As the organ that first engages the outer world, the eye naturally became a prime motif in character formation, yielding graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">臣</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="望.html">望</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="監.html">監</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="相.html">相</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">限</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="見.html">見</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="看.html">看</a> that incorporate <span class="kanji-inline">目</span> as a core element. Looking is the first act in meeting another person, and by extension the character also touches on silent communication of the mind. Related forms clarify this focus: <span class="kanji-inline">眉</span> depicts the brows set above the eyes, while <span class="kanji-inline">媚</span> originally evoked a woman shaman with fixed, adorned eyebrows. Because the eyes and brows are the most striking features of the face, the compound <span class="kanji-inline">眉</span><span class="kanji-inline">目</span> came to mean one’s facial features or overall appearance.</p>
