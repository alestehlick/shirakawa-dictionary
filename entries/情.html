    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">情</span> is a phono-semantic character: the heart radical <span class="kanji-inline">忄</span> indicates the domain of mind and feeling, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="青.html">青</a> provides the sound, pointing to the On reading sei (and by extension jo). The character expresses the movements of the heart when it responds to things—emotion as the mind’s active functioning. In Song learning (Xingli), <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="性.html">性</a> “nature” was treated as substance and yang, while <span class="kanji-inline">情</span> was its functioning and yin, the way nature manifests in response. The Book of Rites (Liyun) defines human feelings as seven innate responses—joy, anger, sorrow, fear, love, dislike, and desire—abilities “possessed without learning,” highlighting <span class="kanji-inline">情</span> as an inborn capacity. By extension it also came to mean sympathy and considerate regard for others.</p>
