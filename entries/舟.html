    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of a boat. In antiquity, boats were dugouts hollowed from single logs, shaped like shallow troughs; their outline matches the basin or plate used to hold food or water. Because this same boat-shaped tub served in acts of giving and receiving, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="受.html">受</a> shows hands placed above and below such a vessel. In <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="癒.html">癒</a> (“to heal”), the right-side element depicts lancing an affected spot with a handled knife and letting the fluid drain into this tub; there, the component written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> is not flesh but the very basin form. In early script, the sign for the receiving tub and the sign for the boat afloat on water are essentially the same figure.</p>
