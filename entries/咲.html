    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats <span class="kanji-inline">咲</span> as a phono‑semantic graph whose older related form is <span class="kanji-inline">唉</span>, combining the mouth <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> with <span class="kanji-inline">矣</span>. He understands <span class="kanji-inline">矣</span> as the figure of a person lifting both hands in cheerful mirth, which also underlies the Go‑on reading shō. In antiquity the action itself was written with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="笑.html">笑</a>, a pure pictograph: a female shaman raises both hands, her body arcing as she dances to entertain and pacify the gods—a form close to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="若.html">若</a>. Although there are no early examples of <span class="kanji-inline">咲</span>, Japanese later adopted this graph for the native verb saku “to bloom.” Earlier expressions spoke of flowers “opening” (hana hiraku), and the choice of <span class="kanji-inline">咲</span> reflects a poetic comparison: a flower unfolding was likened to a person’s mouth opening in a smile, hence its use in words such as hana‑zaku.</p>
