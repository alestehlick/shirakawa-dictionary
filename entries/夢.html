    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">莧</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夕.html">夕</a>. <span class="kanji-inline">莧</span> depicts a seated female shaman with heavily drawn eyebrows; in related forms she appears praying within the ancestral mausoleum. With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夕.html">夕</a> marking the night, the graph presents dreams as nocturnal visitations brought forth through the workings of a spirit under a shaman’s ritual agency. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">夢</span> means both “dream” and “to dream.” Ancient institutions even appointed specialists in dream divination (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="占.html">占</a><span class="kanji-inline">夢</span>), and at year’s end a rite called <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="堂.html">堂</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="贈.html">贈</a> was performed to review and send off the year’s dreams, exorcising ill-omened ones. The term <span class="kanji-inline">菀</span>, used for the death of nobles, was understood as death caused by a dream demon (<span class="kanji-inline">夢</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="魔.html">魔</a>), showing how seriously nightmares were regarded.</p>
