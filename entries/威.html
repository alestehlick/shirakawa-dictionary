    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This compound graph joins <span class="kanji-inline">戊</span>, here representing the great ceremonial axe (yue, a masakari) endowed with purifying and exorcising power, to <span class="kanji-inline">女</span>, “woman.” It pictures a woman serving in ancestral rites within the mausoleum, ritually purified by the sacred axe and adopting a solemn, dignified bearing. From this setting it originally conveyed the rectification of posture and conduct in ritual—majestic comportment and dignity (igi)—hence the sense of “solemn.” In later usage it came to mean the power to overawe, to frighten, and to menace. As an aside, <span class="kanji-inline">縅</span> (odoshi), the term for the colored lacing that binds the plates of Japanese armor, is a character coined in Japan.</p>
