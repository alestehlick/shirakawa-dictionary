    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">擴</span>, this is a phono-semantic character. The element <span class="kanji-inline">広</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">廣</span> depicts a spacious, wide building and supplies the idea of breadth, while also signaling the Sino-Japanese reading. By adding the hand classifier <span class="kanji-inline">手</span>, the graph turns that quality into an action—making something wide—so the reading shifts slightly as the adjective becomes a verb. The older form <span class="kanji-inline">彍</span>, meaning to draw a bow to its fullest, reinforces the image of stretching to the utmost. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">拡</span> came to mean to make wide and big: to enlarge and to expand.</p>
