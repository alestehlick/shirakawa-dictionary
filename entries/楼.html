    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">樓</span>, with <span class="kanji-inline">婁</span> (rō) as the phonetic element. <span class="kanji-inline">婁</span> depicts a woman’s hair piled up and fastened with an ornamental pin, and carries the sense of being heaped up layer upon layer. From that image, <span class="kanji-inline">楼</span> came to mean a structure built in stacked tiers—a tall pavilion or tower, including watchtowers. In ancient times such towers were erected as sacred buildings to welcome the gods; later they acquired political and military functions.</p>
