    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">拾</span> is a phono-semantic character: the hand element implies action, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="合.html">合</a> serves as the phonetic and conceptual core. In ancient form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="合.html">合</a> depicts a vessel fitted with its lid, an image of things coming together. By extension, <span class="kanji-inline">拾</span> expresses gathering and bringing scattered things into order. Its On reading follows <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="合.html">合</a>, though the sound has shifted over time, as seen in other characters with altered Sino-Japanese readings. This sense of orderly collection appears in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">拾</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="収.html">収</a> (shushu), which denotes putting confusion in good order. The graph is also used as a substitute for <span class="kanji-inline">渉</span>, giving the reading shō in expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">拾</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="級.html">級</a> (shōkyū), describing ascending steps carefully, level by level. To prevent easy alteration of numerals, <span class="kanji-inline">拾</span> is sometimes written in place of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="十.html">十</a> in contexts like amounts and tallies.</p>
