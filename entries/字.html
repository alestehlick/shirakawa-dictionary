    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">字</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span>, the roofline of the ancestral mausoleum, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a>, a child. It evokes the rite held in the ancestors’ hall some days after a birth, once the infant’s survival seemed likely. There the child received an auxiliary name, the azana or courtesy name—also called a “small name.” Later, at a further rite announcing the child’s growth, a formal personal name (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="名.html">名</a>) was bestowed, and a graph related to that personal name was chosen and conferred as the <span class="kanji-inline">字</span>. In everyday life one avoided using the true personal name and instead used this courtesy name. Because the child’s nurture and social presentation were affirmed through these ceremonies, <span class="kanji-inline">字</span> came to suggest both the act of rearing and the bestowed epithet; from this practice the sense broadened to the written “character,” as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="文.html">文</a><span class="kanji-inline">字</span>. In Japanese, aza names a subdivision within a village or town.</p>
