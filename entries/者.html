    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In Shirakawa’s view, <span class="kanji-inline">者</span> depicts an earthwork. Branches are piled up above the sun sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a> and coated with earth <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a>; in early graphs a small dot marks the covering soil that seals and hides what lies within. Such clay fences once encircled villages, and a covenant charm was buried in their midst—a receptacle holding prayer texts to the deities. The characters inscribed on this talisman give rise to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="書.html">書</a>, formed by placing the brush sign <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span> over <span class="kanji-inline">者</span>, originally denoting sacred writing used for exorcism. The same earthwork image underlies <span class="kanji-inline">堵</span> “clay wall,” expands to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="都.html">都</a>, a walled city, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="京.html">京</a>, the arched city gate—hence names like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="京.html">京</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="都.html">都</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="京.html">京</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="師.html">師</a> for a fortified capital. From an original sense of an earthwork and the act of concealing, <span class="kanji-inline">者</span> later shifted to mean “person,” and it now functions as an agentive suffix in compounds such as isha, gakusha, and shisha.</p>
