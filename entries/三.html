    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>An indicative graph showing three counting rods laid one above another, reflecting how numbers were tallied; in oracle-bone inscriptions the numerals from one to four appear in just this way. The shape also evokes three ornamental hairpins gathered and set into a coiffure, a motif that lies behind <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="参.html">参</a> and suggests the idea of assembling. Three thus names the triad of heaven, earth, and human, revered as a sacred number, and many traditional named groupings (meisu) are organized by threes, proliferating into the hundreds and thousands.</p>
