    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">壊</span> as a picto‑phonetic character whose traditional form is <span class="kanji-inline">壞</span>. The right-hand element is <span class="kanji-inline">裹</span> (kai) acting as the phonetic, but in older variants it is a mourning graph made by adding <span class="kanji-inline">眾</span>—the image of tears streaming from the eyes—to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衣.html">衣</a> “clothing,” conjuring the scene of weeping at the collar of a dead person’s garment (the sentiment preserved in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="懐.html">懐</a>/<span class="kanji-inline">懷</span>). Some ancient forms show those tears falling onto <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> “earth,” the base graph of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="社.html">社</a> “shrine,” indicating that such rites were held at the communal shrine. A Zhou-script form further adds <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span> “to strike,” pointing to the ritual dismantling of the clan or regional shrine when people were forced to leave their land. From these rites the sense of tearing down and breaking arose. In the modern Japanese form, <span class="kanji-inline">眾</span> is simplified to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="目.html">目</a>, omitting the strokes that depict the falling tears.</p>
