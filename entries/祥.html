    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">祥</span> is a phono-semantic character: the altar element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a> (here in its abbreviated form <span class="kanji-inline">礻</span>) sets a ritual, divinatory scene, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羊.html">羊</a> acts as the phonetic that gives the on reading sho, as in <span class="kanji-inline">庠</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="詳.html">詳</a>. Yet <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羊.html">羊</a> also carries meaning from ancient practice, where a sheep was used in ordeals and offered as a sacred sacrifice—the same dignifying resonance seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="義.html">義</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">善</span>. From this background, <span class="kanji-inline">祥</span> originally named a favorable verdict in divination obtained through a sheep, and so it came to mean happiness and auspiciousness. In later usage it further broadened to the foretoken itself—the mark or sign by which one anticipates good or ill fortune.</p>
