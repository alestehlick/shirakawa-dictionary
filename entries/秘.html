    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph whose older form is <span class="kanji-inline">祕</span>, later standardized as <span class="kanji-inline">秘</span>. The phonetic element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="必.html">必</a> originally depicts the head of a halberd or broad axe fixed to its shaft. In related graphs, <span class="kanji-inline">宓</span> shows that weapon head laid to rest within a mausoleum where ancestral spirits are venerated, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="密.html">密</a> adds fire to indicate a rite of exorcism and purification by flame, seeking tranquility for the ancestors’ souls. In <span class="kanji-inline">祕</span>, adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a> (the ritual altar) to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="必.html">必</a> pictures offering the weapon head before the gods. Because rites using this weapon head as a cursing implement were conducted out of sight as secret ceremonies, the character came to mean “secret,” as well as “to enshrine, to hoard, to conceal.” Today <span class="kanji-inline">秘</span> is the commonly used form.</p>
