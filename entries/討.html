    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a> as the phonetic element, <span class="kanji-inline">討</span> goes back to a hand-image: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a> is understood as a form of <span class="kanji-inline">丑</span>, showing fingers bent and gripping with force. From this image of applying pressure or a decisive grasp arose the sense of punitive action—‘to strike’ or ‘to chastise’—attested in classical passages that speak of punishing or subduing rebels, as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">討</span><span class="kanji-inline">伐</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">征</span><span class="kanji-inline">討</span>. From the notion of pressing firmly came a figurative extension to the life of words: in <span class="kanji-inline">討</span><span class="kanji-inline">究</span> it means to probe or inquire deeply, and in <span class="kanji-inline">討</span><span class="kanji-inline">議</span>・<span class="kanji-inline">討</span><span class="kanji-inline">論</span> it denotes rigorous debate—pressing an issue by thorough examination and exchange.</p>
