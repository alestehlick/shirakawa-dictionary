    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, <span class="kanji-inline">尽</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span>—an image of a hand gripping a slender bough-like rod—with a dish and drops of water, depicting a thin stick being scrubbed in a basin. The scene conveys washing something thoroughly until nothing remains. From this vivid act of exhaustive cleansing, the character came to mean driving a thing to its limit: to exhaust or use up, to run short and come to an end, and by extension, to do something to the utmost and to denote “entirely” or “all.”</p>
