    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="商.html">商</a> serves as the phonetic, supplying the on-yomi teki. Shirakawa reads <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="商.html">商</a> as a form combining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="帝.html">帝</a>, the Supreme Deity, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>, the covenant vessel that receives written prayers, and takes it to denote a person qualified to recite those prayers—a rightful descendant fit to inherit, the original graph of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="嫡.html">嫡</a>. Adding <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>, the hand with a stick meaning “to strike,” turns the whole toward the idea of opposing or striking at that rightful heir, hence “enemy,” “opponent,” or “rival.” From this sense also comes the notion of being a match or equal, as in expressions like hittteki, “to be evenly matched.”</p>
