    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound, <span class="kanji-inline">勤</span> sets <span class="kanji-inline">堇</span> as the sound marker for kin while drawing on its stark imagery: an ancient shaman, bearing a ritual covenant vessel for petitions on the head, hands crossed and bound, a figure tied to ceremonies seeking rain in famine. The accompanying <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a> is taken as the outline of a plow (<span class="kanji-inline">耒</span>), the implement of cultivation. Together they evoke exertion in the fields to stave off hunger, and from this scene the character comes to mean to strive and apply oneself in service—working diligently, being fit for duty, and making sustained effort.</p>
