    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">使</span> as a picto‑phonetic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="史.html">史</a> supplying the on‑reading shi. In the oracle‑bone and bronze scripts, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="史.html">史</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">使</span> are essentially the same figure: a covenant vessel (sai) fastened to a tall, forked wooden staff held aloft in the hand during state rites for ancestral spirits. When envoys set out to the provinces to offer sacrifices to mountains and rivers, they carried this ritual staff fitted with the covenant receptacle and streamers. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">使</span> first meant an envoy or messenger and, by extension, the act of dispatching one, later broadening to the general sense of using people or things. The same ritual scene also lies behind <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="事.html">事</a>, whose early graph matches those of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="史.html">史</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">使</span>.</p>
