    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">隨</span>, with <span class="kanji-inline">隋</span> serving as the phonetic. In <span class="kanji-inline">隋</span>, the left component <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">阝</span>) depicts the stepped divine ladder by which the gods descend and ascend. On the right, <span class="kanji-inline">左</span> shows a hand grasping a ritual implement, and <span class="kanji-inline">月</span> is the abbreviated form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肉.html">肉</a>, a meat offering. Together they portray presenting meat before the gods’ ladder while holding a ritual instrument, praying and divining for the deities’ whereabouts. From the act of going to where the gods are and moving in their train arose the senses “to accompany” and “to follow,” which <span class="kanji-inline">随</span> conveys.</p>
