    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the water element supplies the sense of flowing water, while the dragon component (ryu/ryo) serves as the phonetic. The Shuowen glosses it as the splashing fall of rain, and it is also explained as the swift, shallow rush of a river—rapids. Early Japanese verse in the Manyoshu evokes this image of rain-swollen mountain streams splashing through shallows, and from this sense of heavy, continuous flow the character in Japanese came to designate the taki, a waterfall. In older usage, what we now call a waterfall was referred to as tarumi.</p>
