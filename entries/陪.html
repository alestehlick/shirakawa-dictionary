    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the left element <span class="kanji-inline">阝</span> (fu) originally depicted the ladder used by the gods to descend and ascend, and by extension evoked the act of being seated together at a sacred place—being at someone’s side. The right element serves as the phonetic, giving the sound bai; in early forms it showed a ripened fruit about to split open, a motif associated with breaking open and an increase in number. Taken together, the graph expresses being alongside another, as when many sit at the side of a superior (<span class="kanji-inline">陪</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="席.html">席</a>), and it extends to the senses of following and attending on someone of higher rank (<span class="kanji-inline">陪</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="従.html">従</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">陪</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="食.html">食</a>), the status of a subordinate or retainer (<span class="kanji-inline">陪</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="臣.html">臣</a>), and participation alongside specialists in judgment (<span class="kanji-inline">陪</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="審.html">審</a>). Thus <span class="kanji-inline">陪</span> centers on the idea of accompanying, attending, and standing by another’s side.</p>
