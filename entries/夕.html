    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of the moon as it appears in the evening—a slim three-day crescent—this character names the time of dusk and evening. To set it apart from the round form of the sun (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>), early scribes drew the moon as a crescent; in oracle-bone and tortoise-shell inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> is marked by a small dot within the crescent, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> lacks that dot. In later script the contrast was fixed as <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> with a single dot-like stroke and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> with two. In the Yin period, morning and evening rites greeted the sun and moon respectively, and meals were taken at those times; since state affairs were conducted at the morning rite, the term <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="朝.html">朝</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="政.html">政</a>, “morning governance,” came to mean political business. Against this cultural backdrop, <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> naturally came to signify the evening.</p>
