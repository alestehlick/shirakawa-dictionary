    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of a bird, drawn with contour lines that show the whole creature in profile. It simply means “bird.” By contrast, <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span> depicts a bird in abbreviated strokes and denotes a short‑tailed bird, serving widely as the bird graph in compounds. In oracle‑bone and bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">鳥</span> appears for sacred birds and even for an astral object called the Bird Star, showing its role in rites and worship. The character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鶏.html">鶏</a> (also written <span class="kanji-inline">鷄</span>) evokes the cock through the onomatopoetic kei of its cry, suggesting that the chicken, too, was regarded as a sacred bird.</p>
