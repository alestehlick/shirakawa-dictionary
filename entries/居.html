    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa traces the character back to an earlier form written <span class="kanji-inline">尻</span>, composed of <span class="kanji-inline">尸</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">几</span>. The top element, <span class="kanji-inline">尸</span>, is a sacred katashiro—an effigy revered as a stand‑in for an ancestor’s spirit—while <span class="kanji-inline">几</span> depicts a low stool or bench. Together they show the ritual substitute seated, evoking a crouching or squatting posture. The later graph <span class="kanji-inline">居</span> is a phono‑semantic development of that form, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="古.html">古</a> serving as the phonetic that yields the On reading ko. Essentially the same character as <span class="kanji-inline">尻</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">居</span> became the one in regular use. In early usage it expressed “to crouch/squat” and the state of being in attendance, as in phrases for being in mourning; from this core sense of remaining in place it broadened to “to be, to stay” and, in everyday language, to the idea of living or dwelling in a place.</p>
