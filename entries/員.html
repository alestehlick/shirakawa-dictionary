    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its oldest form, the character shows a round ding, a ritual tripod cauldron, marked with a small circle to indicate its roundness; the element later written as <span class="kanji-inline">貝</span> is an abbreviated form of <span class="kanji-inline">鼎</span>. When that whole figure was enclosed within a surrounding circle it produced <span class="kanji-inline">圓</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="円.html">円</a>), “round.” <span class="kanji-inline">員</span> itself was originally the mark used to count the number of such round tripods, hence the sense “number,” and by extension it came to denote those included in a tally—the “members” of a group.</p>
