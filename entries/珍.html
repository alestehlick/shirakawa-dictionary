    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the oldest tortoise-plastron forms, this character pictured a shell carefully wrapped, evoking a prized object. In later script it became a phono-semantic compound: the jade radical supplies the meaning of treasure or preciousness, while the phonetic on the right belongs to the <span class="kanji-inline">㐱</span> series—graphically a figure with abundant hair—which contributes sound rather than sense. This series, recognizable by the element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="今.html">今</a> as a sound marker, also appears in graphs like <span class="kanji-inline">趁</span> and supports the on reading chin. The Shuowen glosses it as “treasure,” specifically fine jade valued as a precious thing, from which the broader sense “rare, unusual” developed.</p>
