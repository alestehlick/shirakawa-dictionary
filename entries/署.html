    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">署</span> as a phono-semantic compound: the phonetic element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a> provides the sound sho, while the upper component <span class="kanji-inline">罒</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">网</span>), the form of a net or screen, evokes the lattice or barrier set over an entrance. Such a marked gateway (a gate-fence) was where the guardhouse stood, the place that controlled access and watched against intruders. From this guard post at the entrance the character came to mean a governmental office. And from the practice of fixing a mark at the door, it naturally extended to the idea of leaving a written mark—hence to sign or to record.</p>
