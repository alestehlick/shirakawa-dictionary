    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the right-side element <span class="kanji-inline">窄</span>, read saku, provides the sound and evokes the act of narrowing a hole by thrusting a bent twig—represented by <span class="kanji-inline">乍</span>—into it. With the hand radical <span class="kanji-inline">扌</span> added, the graph depicts forcing a small branch into an opening by hand and compressing it, an image of applying pressure to squeeze or wring. From this concrete action, <span class="kanji-inline">搾</span> came to mean shiboru, to squeeze or wring, and it is a relatively late formation not recorded in the oldest dictionaries.</p>
