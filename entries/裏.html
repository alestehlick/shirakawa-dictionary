    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character in which <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="里.html">里</a> serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on-yomi ri. In the Shuowen it is explained as the inside of a garment, that is, the reverse or lining, and from this core sense it came to mean the back, reverse, and interior more generally. The Book of Odes illustrates this with the line “green robe, yellow lining” (<span class="kanji-inline">綠</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衣.html">衣</a><span class="kanji-inline">黃</span><span class="kanji-inline">裏</span>), clearly using <span class="kanji-inline">裏</span> for the lining. Bronze inscriptions likewise show <span class="kanji-inline">裏</span> in contexts such as a ceremonial gift of red cloth backed with tiger hide, an emblem hung on a chariot—usage that highlights the notion of a backing or inner side. <span class="kanji-inline">裡</span> is a later popular variant form.</p>
