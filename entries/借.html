    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Borrow is a phono-semantic character formed with the person element on the left and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="昔.html">昔</a> as its phonetic on the right, which supplies the on-reading shaku and ties it to the same series as <span class="kanji-inline">藉</span> (“to spread”). The Shuowen glosses it as “to borrow; to make use of,” with the key nuance of something provisional or temporary. In early usage it also appears adverbially in expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">借</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="使.html">使</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">借</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="如.html">如</a>, meaning “if, suppose,” and the Book of Odes (Greater Odes, Yoku) employs <span class="kanji-inline">借</span> in this concessive sense. From the core idea of making temporary use grew the everyday meanings of borrowing and, by extension, the paired notion of lending and borrowing (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貸.html">貸</a><span class="kanji-inline">借</span>) of goods or money.</p>
