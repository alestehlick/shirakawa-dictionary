    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">室</span> joins the roof sign <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="至.html">至</a>. The roof is that of a mausoleum, a place where ancestral spirits were venerated. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="至.html">至</a> depicts an arrow turned downward to mark the exact spot where it has landed—the site chosen in an old ritual: a sacred arrow was loosed from a fixed point, and where it came to rest became the place to build. By placing the roof over this “arrived-at spot,” the character portrays the chamber raised there for ancestral worship. From this ritual sense it broadened to mean a room in general, and by extension a house, household, or family. Characters such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="屋.html">屋</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="臺.html">臺</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">台</span>) also incorporate <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="至.html">至</a>, reflecting the same practice of determining a building site by the arrow’s fall. In Japanese, this origin lingers in usages like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="氷.html">氷</a><span class="kanji-inline">室</span> (himuro), an ice cellar—literally a “chamber” for preserving winter ice.</p>
