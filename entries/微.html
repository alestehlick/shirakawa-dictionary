    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">微</span> as a picto-phonetic graph grounded in a ritual scene. The old form shows a long-haired female shaman, to whom the striking hand (<span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>) is applied, depicting the counter-magic of beating enemy priestesses to break and dispel their power. With <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>—the left half of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a> that evokes a crossroads—added, the rite is situated on the roadway where it was performed. From the core sense of driving off and weakening opposing magic, the character comes to mean to diminish or weaken, and then naturally extends to faint, slight, and by extension secret. It is allied with <span class="kanji-inline">蔑</span>, which portrays seizing and killing an enemy shaman to strip her of power; both graphs memorialize related magical actions.</p>
