    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">廃</span> is a phono-semantic character, originally written <span class="kanji-inline">廢</span>, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="発.html">発</a> as its phonetic element—<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="発.html">発</a> evoking the loosing of the first arrow that opens a campaign. In earlier usage, the sense ‘to stop, abolish; to throw away’ was written with <span class="kanji-inline">灋</span>, the older form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="法.html">法</a>. Bronze inscriptions even record the injunction <span class="kanji-inline">勿</span><span class="kanji-inline">灋</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="朕.html">朕</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a>, “Do not cast away my command.” The graph <span class="kanji-inline">灋</span> depicts throwing into water the person (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>) who has failed a divine ordeal, together with the covenant vessel whose lid has been removed (<span class="kanji-inline">凵</span>) and the sacred beast <span class="kanji-inline">廌</span>; from this imagery arose the meaning “to throw away.” From <span class="kanji-inline">灋</span> later developed <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="法.html">法</a> (with the beast element abbreviated) in the sense of “law, rule,” while <span class="kanji-inline">廃</span>, built with the roof-like element <span class="kanji-inline">广</span> suggesting a building and the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="発.html">発</a>, came to mean “to cease, to fall out of use, to discard,” originally evoking the disposal of a structure judged no longer useful.</p>
