    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">斷</span>, the character combines the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="系.html">系</a> element—depicting a thread broken in two and set in a loom—with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斤.html">斤</a>, the axe used to cut it. It first meant the cutting of a thread, and by extension came to express cutting off or severing in general; from this core image it further developed senses such as discarding or abandoning, declining or refusing, and, by making a decisive “cut,” laying down a decision.</p>
