    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form is <span class="kanji-inline">產</span>, combining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="文.html">文</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="生.html">生</a> beneath a component shaped like a forehead (<span class="kanji-inline">厂</span>). Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="文.html">文</a> is the ritual tattoo or painted mark—drawn in red or black—while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="生.html">生</a> evokes birth. The graph portrays the ceremony of marking a newborn’s brow, often with an X, to protect the child’s indwelling spirit and bar malign influences. Comparable customs were known in Japan, where an X or the character for “dog” (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a>) was dabbed on a baby’s forehead with soot or crimson. From this image of a birth rite safeguarding the new life, the character came to mean “to give birth, to be born,” and by extension “to produce, to bring forth.”</p>
