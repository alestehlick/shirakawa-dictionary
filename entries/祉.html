    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">祉</span> is a phono-semantic character: the left side is <span class="kanji-inline">礻</span> (the altar hand of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a>), signaling matters of divine favor and ritual, while the right side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a> supplies the sound shi. The Shuowen already glosses it as akin to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="福.html">福</a>, “good fortune,” and in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="福.html">福</a><span class="kanji-inline">祉</span> it denotes welfare and happiness. In the Book of Odes it appears in lines such as “he received the blessing of the god” and “they deigned to bestow this happiness,” showing that <span class="kanji-inline">祉</span> originally evoked happiness as a boon conferred by the gods—a blessing granted through sacred favor rather than mere happenstance.</p>
