    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with the water element on the left and <span class="kanji-inline">弗</span> as the phonetic. Shirakawa describes <span class="kanji-inline">弗</span> as a rope twisted lengthwise around several pieces of wood, evoking crooked, unbindable wood that scatters and resists constraint—an image of things refusing to stay together. In <span class="kanji-inline">沸</span> this phonetic supplies both sound and the sense of bursting apart; combined with water, it depicts liquid heated until it breaks into motion, boiling and bubbling up. Thus compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">沸</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="騰.html">騰</a> name the boiling of water and other liquids, and the character also extends to figurative uses for states that grow hot, bubble up, or fall into an uproar.</p>
