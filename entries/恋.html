    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">戀</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the heart component gives the sense of feeling, while the phonetic is allied to <span class="kanji-inline">攣</span> (ren), a graph meaning to draw together or bend, which supplies the sound and evokes a heart pulled toward someone. Early literature already uses it for tender remembrance, as in the Han Shu, and old annotations even note that <span class="kanji-inline">攣</span> can be read as <span class="kanji-inline">戀</span>, glossing it as the heart being attracted—to love and to yearn. From this, the character came to express love and longing.</p>
