    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">綱</span> is a phono-semantic character. The silk radical <span class="kanji-inline">糸</span> indicates something made of cord or threads, while <span class="kanji-inline">岡</span> functions as the phonetic and also contributes meaning. Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">岡</span> as a figure of a casting mold subjected to fire—here expressed by the element shaped like a mountain, <span class="kanji-inline">山</span>—evoking the intense heating that bakes and hardens the mold. From this image <span class="kanji-inline">岡</span> carries the sense of being tightened and made firm. Accordingly, <span class="kanji-inline">綱</span> names a rope formed by twisting strands into a single, tough cable that cannot easily be cut. By extension it means a rope, the act of drawing things together or collecting them, and in compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a><span class="kanji-inline">綱</span> it signifies the main outline or fundamental framework.</p>
