    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">組</span> is a phono-semantic character: the silk element points to threadwork, and the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="且.html">且</a> gives the on reading so. Early lexica define it as a kind of braided cord (kumihimo), classed among the <span class="kanji-inline">綬</span>; a small one served as a crown cord. A slender, tightly plaited cord was called <span class="kanji-inline">纓</span>, while <span class="kanji-inline">綬</span> named the larger type. Because a braid is formed by bringing many threads together, the character naturally extended to the ideas of assembling and combining—hence compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">組</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="織.html">織</a>, originally the interlacing of threads to make a whole and by extension an organized body, and <span class="kanji-inline">組</span><span class="kanji-inline">繡</span>, embroidered work. From the concrete image of a braid arose the general senses “to construct, to put together,” and “a pair or set.”</p>
