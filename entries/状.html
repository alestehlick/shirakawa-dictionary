    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">狀</span>, this is a phono-semantic character. The component <span class="kanji-inline">爿</span> serves as the phonetic and pictures the upright board used in rammed-earth construction (hanchiku), while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a> represents a dog offered in a foundation rite. The graph thus evokes the ritual by which a new wall or building was solemnly fixed, and from that sense of determining a structure’s state it came to mean the present condition or anticipated aspect of things—their look or figure (as in a person’s countenance). By further extension it also came to denote a written note or document, and a tag or plate.</p>
