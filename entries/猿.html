    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the animal radical marks a beast, while <span class="kanji-inline">袁</span> (also written as <span class="kanji-inline">爰</span>), which shares the on reading en, supplies the sound. Related forms such as <span class="kanji-inline">蝯</span> are also seen. The link with <span class="kanji-inline">爰</span> is especially telling, as it is the phonetic in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="援.html">援</a>, evoking reaching, grasping, and hauling up—apt images for a monkey with long arms, skilled at taking things and climbing trees. In ancient China, the animal was also written <span class="kanji-inline">狻</span>.</p>
