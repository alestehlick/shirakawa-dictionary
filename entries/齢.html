    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its original form <span class="kanji-inline">齡</span>, this is a phono‑semantic compound: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="令.html">令</a> supplies the sound and points to the on‑yomi rei, while <span class="kanji-inline">齒</span> “teeth” provides the meaning. Classical lexica gloss it simply as “years, age.” The choice of the tooth component reflects a familiar practice—one judges the age of animals like dogs or horses by the condition of their teeth—and in human life too, the early passage of years shows clearly in the sequence of teeth erupting and being shed. From this concrete index of time, the character came to signify a person’s years.</p>
