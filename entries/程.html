    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">程</span> is a phono-semantic compound with <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span>, the grain plant, as its semantic core and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="呈.html">呈</a> (tei) as its phonetic. In Shirakawa’s reading, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="呈.html">呈</a> depicts hands lifting the sai—a covenant vessel that held written prayers—up to the gods. Joined with the grain element, the character evokes offering grain in prayer for a good harvest. From the measuring and apportioning of grain for such offerings, the sense broadened to measurement and gradation: fixed amounts, degrees, and regulated standards, then further to prescribed courses or stages such as itineraries and daily schedules. Ancient lexica already record it as a small unit of length, underscoring its fundamental idea of an established measure.</p>
