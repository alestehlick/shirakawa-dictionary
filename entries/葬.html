    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound character combining the grass element and the graph for death. The grass evokes the ancient practice of first setting out the corpse among vegetation, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="死.html">死</a> depicts a figure bowing in reverence before the bones of the dead, the ribs rising from the chest. In early custom, the body was exposed until the flesh weathered away; the cleaned bones were then gathered and interred—this secondary interment is what <span class="kanji-inline">葬</span> names. Hence terms like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="複.html">複</a><span class="kanji-inline">葬</span>, referring to such multiple or secondary burial, and <span class="kanji-inline">殯</span> for the rite of placing the corpse in a plank-built shelter while awaiting that weathering.</p>
