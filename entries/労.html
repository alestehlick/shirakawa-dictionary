    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form is <span class="kanji-inline">勞</span>, combining a sign for the courtyard watch-fire (a sacred niwabi) with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a>, which here sketches a plow. The graph evokes a rite in which the plow was purified and exorcized in sacred fire at the beginning and end of the farming season, a ceremony meant to ward off insect damage and secure a rich harvest. A related idea appears in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="静.html">静</a>, where purification is done with blue pigment. Bronze inscriptions also show a variant with two fires above and a garment below, suggesting the same fire-purification performed on clothing. From this ritual context, the character first expressed the benevolent response of the gods—rewarding, helping, and showing compassion for human effort—before later extending to the notions of serving and working (as in kinrō), and by further shift to the fatigue and hardship that accompany exertion.</p>
