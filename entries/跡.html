    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A picto-phonetic graph. The earliest writing is <span class="kanji-inline">迹</span>, and an even older form is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="速.html">速</a>, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="束.html">束</a> as the phonetic. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="束.html">束</a> depicts a tree set upright as a landmark; <span class="kanji-inline">亦</span> is a later confusion for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="束.html">束</a> and unrelated. In this view, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="速.html">速</a> originally described erecting a marker tree as a sign for operations, and from the mark left standing arose the sense of a “trace.” In bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">賚</span> is borrowed to write seki in phrases like <span class="kanji-inline">禹</span><span class="kanji-inline">之</span><span class="kanji-inline">賚</span>, “the traces of Yu,” referring to the marks of the flood-tamer’s works spread across the realm. Later, the foot element was added to create <span class="kanji-inline">跡</span> specifically for “footmarks,” which then generalized to any trace. By extension it can express treading or visiting a place by following someone’s traces, and it is often used in place of <span class="kanji-inline">蹟</span>.</p>
