    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In Shirakawa’s view, <span class="kanji-inline">更</span> is a compound graph built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丙.html">丙</a>, which originally depicted a stand or pedestal for setting a utensil or vessel. Bronze forms show two such stands stacked, with the striking hand/stroke (<span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>) applied from below—an image of tapping and readjusting the vessel on its stand to restore and keep its function going. From this concrete act of correction and renewal arose the senses “to change,” “to renew,” and by extension “again, further” for continued action. Carried over to time, it came to mean that the night grows late and, by further extension, that one grows older. Shirakawa also connects it with the ritual, incantatory nuance seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="改.html">改</a>, treating <span class="kanji-inline">更</span> as a kindred act of magical renewal.</p>
