    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">激</span> is a phono-semantic compound: water on the left gives the semantic field, while the right-side phonetic is <span class="kanji-inline">敫</span>, which also appears in <span class="kanji-inline">檄</span> (“written proclamation”) and points to the on reading geki. Shirakawa parses <span class="kanji-inline">敫</span> as <span class="kanji-inline">白</span> added to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="放.html">放</a>. In bronze and oracle forms, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="放.html">放</a> shows <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="方.html">方</a>—a body hung crosswise—struck with <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>, the ritual beating used to drive away harmful spirits; <span class="kanji-inline">白</span> depicts the withered, rain-whitened skull. Together, <span class="kanji-inline">敫</span> pictures striking the hanged dead, a rite meant to rouse and incite the fierce energy of the spirit. From this core idea of stimulation that makes things fierce comes the sense of violence and intensity; with the water element attached, it becomes water that surges and lashes violently. By extension, <span class="kanji-inline">激</span> came to denote intensity and vehemence in general.</p>
