    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character joins the person graph <span class="kanji-inline">人</span> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="系.html">系</a>, the strands used for decorative threading. In ancient usage, adorning a person with such threads signified fastening them into a bond—linking and keeping them in a continuing connection. From that image, <span class="kanji-inline">係</span> came to express being tied to something or someone, and by extension the state of relationship or involvement seen in compounds like kankei, as well as the encumbrances hinted at in keirui. In Japanese it also yields kakari, the person responsible for a task or office, the one “attached” to a duty.</p>
