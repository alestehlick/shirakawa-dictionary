    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally, <span class="kanji-inline">弱</span> was drawn as two bows set side by side, evoking the lighter ceremonial bow—softer and less forceful than a war bow. The paired bows thus pictured a “weak bow,” and from this concrete image the character broadened to mean weakness in general and, by extension, inferiority. Because it shares the Sino-Japanese reading jaku with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="若.html">若</a>, it was also at times used to write the sense “young” as a phonetic borrowing.</p>
