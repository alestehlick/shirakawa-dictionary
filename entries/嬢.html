    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, originally written <span class="kanji-inline">孃</span>, formed with the woman radical and <span class="kanji-inline">襄</span> as the phonetic that signals the reading jō. Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">襄</span> as depicting two covenant vessels (sai) and four ritual “curse” implements arranged at the collar of funerary attire, an image that evokes a chest swelling and rounding. With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a> added, the graph came to denote a woman of full, well-shaped form, and by extension was used for close female relations—mother and daughter. In later usage, the simpler <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="娘.html">娘</a> was also written for these senses.</p>
