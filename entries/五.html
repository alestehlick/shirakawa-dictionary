    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">五</span> as the image of a double wooden lid, two planks crossed diagonally to seal a sacred receptacle. Its use as the numeral “five” is a loan based on the on reading go, whereas the characters for one through four arose directly from tally rods set side by side. The same “double lid” form also appears in <span class="kanji-inline">吾</span>, where it is placed atop a covenant vessel that held written prayers; sealing the lid preserves their power, giving rise to notions of protecting and warding off. As a numeral, <span class="kanji-inline">五</span> is widely used as a name-number in expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">五</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a>, the five circulating agents, and <span class="kanji-inline">五</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="倫.html">倫</a>, the five human relations.</p>
