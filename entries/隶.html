    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its ancient conception the character is built from three elements: <span class="kanji-inline">祟</span>, depicting a beast endowed with a baneful spiritual power; <span class="kanji-inline">巾</span>, a cloth; and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>, a hand. The idea is of touching the beast with a cloth so that its curse is transferred to the cloth, then making someone carry that cloth in the hand—thus the curse “attaches” to that person. Such people, marked by the transferred impurity, were assigned to serve the gods as temple servants, hence the sense of ‘slave/servant.’ This original notion of attachment aligns with the Shuowen’s gloss “to adhere,” and in later usage the word broadened to mean ‘servant’ and ‘to follow.’ The commonly used form <span class="kanji-inline">隷</span> is a later, altered shape of this graph.</p>
