    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character shows a figure with long hair seen in profile, the hair hanging down as a sign of age, combined with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="七.html">七</a>, an ancient form depicting a person turned upside down, the image of a body laid out in death. Together they suggest one approaching the end of life: a person grown old. From this comes the senses “to grow old” and “to become decrepit,” and by extension “an elderly person.”</p>
