    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the ancient graph, <span class="kanji-inline">述</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span>, the sign of going along a road, with <span class="kanji-inline">朮</span>, depicted as a spirit-charged animal used in divination. On campaign, such divination determined whether an army should advance or withdraw, and <span class="kanji-inline">述</span> names the act of proceeding in accordance with that verdict—thus, to follow what has been revealed. Related graphs include <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遂.html">遂</a>, which expresses carrying on once the omen’s result is known, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="術.html">術</a>, the practice of such divination performed on the road. From this core notion of following and transmitting a decided course, <span class="kanji-inline">述</span> came to mean passing on what has been handed down, as in the Analects’ <span class="kanji-inline">述</span><span class="kanji-inline">而</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="不.html">不</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="作.html">作</a>, “I transmit and do not create,” and hence the later, common sense “to state, to relate.”</p>
