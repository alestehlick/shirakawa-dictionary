    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: in bronze inscriptions it follows the walking sign <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> (later the left-side <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>), combined with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a> as a phonetic giving the sound to. The Shuowen glosses it “to walk, to go,” which underlies the sense of going on foot (toho). Because <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a> is the ancient graph that also stands at the root of <span class="kanji-inline">社</span>, the shrine-centered community, <span class="kanji-inline">徒</span> came to denote the people attached to such a shrine—hence companions, a group, or the people at large. By further extension it is used adverbially for senses like mere or only, and sometimes for alone.</p>
