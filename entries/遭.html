    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character. The semantic element <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">辶</span>) marks movement along a road. The phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="曹.html">曹</a> (so), in its early form, depicts two people—the accuser and the accused—placing bundles of arrows into a bag-like vessel (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="東.html">東</a> used as the form of <span class="kanji-inline">橐</span>, “bag”) as a solemn oath before the gods to initiate a trial. With the road radical added, the graph came to picture two people coming together on the way, giving the sense “to encounter, to run into unexpectedly,” as seen in compounds like<span class="kanji-inline">遭</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遇.html">遇</a>.</p>
