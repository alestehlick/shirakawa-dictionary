    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">割</span> is a phono-semantic compound. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="害.html">害</a> provides the sound and conjures a ritual image: a covenant vessel (sai), into which written prayers to the gods are placed, is pierced with a large handled pin, an act that ruins the efficacy of those petitions—spoiling them. With the addition of the knife element <span class="kanji-inline">刂</span>, that destructive act is emphasized as cutting, so the character comes to mean to part and sever—divide, split, and break—and, by extension, to spoil.</p>
