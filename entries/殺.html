    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">殺</span> as a compound graph: on the left stands the figure of a curse-bearing animal, marked by a small dot for its ear, and on the right <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>, the long-handled pike (an elongated<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>). The scene shows striking down the animal that has brought a curse, thereby weakening and neutralizing its baneful power. From this, the original sense is to lessen or blunt a harmful influence—hence uses like gensai “to reduce”—and only subsequently did it come to mean simply “to kill.” In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions the character is written with just the animal figure, a usage later seen with <span class="kanji-inline">蔡</span> for “to kill.”</p>
