    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character. The ancient form shows the threads spread on a loom being cut into two, and another element portrays threads severed by an axe. With <span class="kanji-inline">糸</span> “thread” added as the semantic component and a phonetic that yields the on reading kei, the character originally evoked joining cut threads—mending and connecting. From this concrete image it came to mean carrying something forward without interruption: to continue what preceded, to take over and succeed to an inheritance or role.</p>
