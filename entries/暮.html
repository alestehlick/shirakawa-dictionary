    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character formed on <span class="kanji-inline">莫</span>, which supplies the on-yomi bo and depicts the sun sinking between blades of grass—a vivid image of day giving way to night. From that picture arose meanings such as “to grow dark,” “dusk,” and “late.” Although <span class="kanji-inline">莫</span> later came to be used as a negator (“not”), the addition of the sun element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a> made the twilight scene explicit and yielded the graph <span class="kanji-inline">暮</span>. In Japanese it also developed the reading kurasu, extending the idea from the close of day to the way one conducts one’s life and makes a living.</p>
