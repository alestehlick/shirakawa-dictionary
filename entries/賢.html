    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">賢</span> as a phono-semantic compound with <span class="kanji-inline">臥</span> as the phonetic element giving the on-reading ken. In archaic forms, <span class="kanji-inline">臥</span> shows a hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>) inserted into <span class="kanji-inline">臣</span>, the eye turned upward with a large pupil, evoking the ritual blinding of a person dedicated to divine service; <span class="kanji-inline">臣</span> thus denotes attendants serving the gods. Among such servants were individuals of extraordinary gifts, and <span class="kanji-inline">臥</span> originally referred to these outstanding figures and, by extension, to wisdom itself. When the prized cowry shell <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>—brought from the distant southern seas and used as precious currency—was added, the character emphasized high value. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">賢</span>, “<span class="kanji-inline">臥</span>” plus “<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>,” came to signify a person of prized, superior ability: wise, clever, and excelling others.</p>
