    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">茂</span> is a phono-semantic character: the grass radical <span class="kanji-inline">艹</span> signals vegetation, while <span class="kanji-inline">戊</span> provides the sound and points toward the idea of dense growth. The Shuowen defines it as “abundant, flourishing grass,” hence the primary sense “to grow thick, luxuriant,” especially of plants and trees. From this image of vigorous profusion, the meaning extends to “to excel,” as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">茂</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="功.html">功</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">茂</span><span class="kanji-inline">材</span>. Its on reading aligns with a kindred character, <span class="kanji-inline">楙</span>, which the Shuowen explains as “a tree’s thick growth,” reinforcing <span class="kanji-inline">茂</span>’s core picture of lush, thriving abundance.</p>
