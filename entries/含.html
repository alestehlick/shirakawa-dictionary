    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">含</span> is a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">今</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>. Shirakawa explains that <span class="kanji-inline">今</span> originally depicted the lid of a jar fitted with a stopcock. The combined graph evokes an ancient funerary rite: placing a piece of jade in the mouth of the deceased and closing it to keep the dead qi from escaping. This mouth-jade, called gangyoku (<span class="kanji-inline">含</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="玉.html">玉</a>), was often carved in the shape of a cicada as a prayer for revival. From the concrete image of holding jade in the mouth, the character came to mean “to keep in the mouth,” and by extension “to contain, include”; in causative use it further developed senses such as “to let something soak in” or “saturate.”</p>
