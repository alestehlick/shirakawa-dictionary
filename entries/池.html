    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">池</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water radical indicates water, while <span class="kanji-inline">也</span> serves as the phonetic, giving the On reading chi. The same <span class="kanji-inline">也</span> appears in characters like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="地.html">地</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">馳</span>, likewise signaling chi. In usage it often referred to man-made waterworks—ditches or basins—hence meanings such as “pond” and, by extension, “moat,” seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">池</span><span class="kanji-inline">苑</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">池</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="亭.html">亭</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="城.html">城</a><span class="kanji-inline">池</span>. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">也</span> was originally shaped like a snake, suggesting a sinuously bent form. A later cultural vignette recalls the Han calligrapher Zhang Zhi, the “Grass Sage,” who practiced by rinsing his brush in a pond; as its waters darkened with ink, it was dubbed the “Ink Pond” (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="墨.html">墨</a><span class="kanji-inline">池</span>).</p>
