    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original graph is <span class="kanji-inline">塑</span>, a phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> “earth” indicating clay and <span class="kanji-inline">朔</span> as the phonetic giving the on-reading so; another early form writes it <span class="kanji-inline">嗉</span>, using <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="素.html">素</a> as the phonetic, likewise read so. Beyond sound, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="素.html">素</a> means “base, raw material,” and <span class="kanji-inline">朔</span> means “beginning,” which suits the idea of starting from a core. The word thus points to a figure modeled in clay—a puppet or effigy—built up by applying clay over a wooden core that serves as the model. Terms such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="泥.html">泥</a><span class="kanji-inline">塑</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="人.html">人</a> refer to a human-shaped clay image, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="偶.html">偶</a> names one made entirely of clay. Tradition even tells that the Yin king Di Yi fashioned clay images of deities and took pleasure in debasing them, an anecdote that underscores the concrete, crafted sense carried by <span class="kanji-inline">塑</span>.</p>
