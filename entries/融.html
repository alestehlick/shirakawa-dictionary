    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">鬲</span>, a three-legged iron cooking tripod that also served to store food, and <span class="kanji-inline">蟲</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="虫.html">虫</a>), insects. The original image is of matter left in the tripod rotting and liquefying as insects breed within and swarm out, which gives the core sense of melting and dissolving. From this, expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">融</span><span class="kanji-inline">然</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">融</span><span class="kanji-inline">融</span> evoke a heart that softens and grows serene, and the character further extends to the ideas of easing, becoming mild, and things pervading or passing through.</p>
