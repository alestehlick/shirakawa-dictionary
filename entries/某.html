    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">某</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="曰.html">曰</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>. In early forms it depicts an inscribed covenant tablet—something written to the gods—fastened to a tree branch as an offering, a rite by which one inquired into and gauged the divine will. From this core sense of consulting and laying out a plan, <span class="kanji-inline">某</span> stands as the original graph of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="謀.html">謀</a> (to plan), and with added elements yields <span class="kanji-inline">媒</span> (to arrange a marriage) and <span class="kanji-inline">禖</span> (a prayer for a child offered at a sacred tree). In later usage it became a placeholder for an unnamed person or thing, as in <span class="kanji-inline">某</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="国.html">国</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">某</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">某</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="所.html">所</a>, and it is read soregashi and nanigashi with the meaning “a certain so-and-so.”</p>
