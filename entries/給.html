    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the thread element signals the realm of goods and distribution, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="合.html">合</a> serves as the phonetic, linked to the <span class="kanji-inline">翕</span> (kyu) sound series with the sense of gathering or bringing together. In bronze inscriptions, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="合.html">合</a> can also write <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="答.html">答</a>, meaning an answer or recompense, particularly a return equal to what was received. Against this background, <span class="kanji-inline">給</span> originally expressed the bestowal granted by a superior, then broadened to the general sense of giving, and further extended to ideas of adding and satisfying or meeting a need.</p>
