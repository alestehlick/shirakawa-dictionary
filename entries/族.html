    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph that joins the clan banner and the arrow. The banner—originally a flagpole with a fixed streamer—was the clan’s standard, borne with the group in war and on the move. The arrow was revered as sacred; in vows made before the gods, one signaled the oath by the gesture of breaking an arrow. In some oracle-bone and bronze forms a covenant container for written prayers is added, underscoring the rite. <span class="kanji-inline">族</span> thus portrays a swearing ceremony at the foot of the clan banner and came to name those bound by that common vow—the fellows of the same lineage—and, because such rites gathered everyone, it also suggests assembling. In the same ritual sphere, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="氏.html">氏</a> depicts a small handled knife used to portion sacrificial meat at the clan banquet after ancestor worship; those who shared that meal were the uji, hence shizoku, the family.</p>
