    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">砲</span> is a phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="包.html">包</a> as its sound marker. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="包.html">包</a> originally depicts an embryo in the belly and carries the sense of wrapping or putting something inside, which neatly evokes the way a charge is packed into the barrel (the hoshin, or cannon tube) before a shot is fired. In early writing the word also appears as <span class="kanji-inline">礮</span>, where a different phonetic element marks the on-reading; both that element and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="包.html">包</a> are taken as echoing the explosive report of a cannon. A related graph, <span class="kanji-inline">炮</span>—elsewhere “to roast” or “to burn”—interchanges with <span class="kanji-inline">礮</span> and is used for the meaning “cannon,” as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a><span class="kanji-inline">砲</span>. In usage, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="銃.html">銃</a> denotes the smaller firearm, while <span class="kanji-inline">砲</span> refers to the large gun.</p>
