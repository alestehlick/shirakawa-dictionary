    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the right-side element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="則.html">則</a> serves as the phonetic, giving the on-reading soku and recalling the act of carving solemn treaty clauses into a bronze tripod (<span class="kanji-inline">鼎</span>) with a knife—inscriptions that became standards or rules (junsoku). With the water element added on the left, <span class="kanji-inline">測</span> came to denote taking soundings, especially measuring the depth of water, and by extension the broader act of measuring or judging whether something accords with a set standard.</p>
