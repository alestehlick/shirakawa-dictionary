    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a phono-semantic compound built on <span class="kanji-inline">夾</span>, which depicts a person carrying another under both arms. With the hand radical added, the image becomes the concrete act of grasping or enclosing with the hands. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">夾</span> supplies the on-reading kyo and the core idea of holding, while the hand element focuses the meaning into actions such as holding something between the hands or objects, pinching, inserting, or being caught in between—extending naturally to the sense of simply holding or embracing.</p>
