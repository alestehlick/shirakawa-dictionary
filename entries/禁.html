    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">禁</span> is built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="林.html">林</a>, a flourishing stand of trees regarded as a sacred grove where the gods dwell, set above <span class="kanji-inline">示</span>, the altar table used in rites of worship. Together they depict the consecrated precinct in a grove where an altar stood and divinity was venerated. Because this was the gods’ own domain, hunting and ordinary entry were off-limits, and from that inviolability the character came to mean prohibition and restraint. By extension, spaces set apart as sacrosanct in human society—such as imperial precincts—were likewise called <span class="kanji-inline">禁</span>, as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">禁</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衛.html">衛</a> (guards of the palace), <span class="kanji-inline">禁</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="中.html">中</a> (the Imperial court), and <span class="kanji-inline">禁</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a> (the palace gate).</p>
