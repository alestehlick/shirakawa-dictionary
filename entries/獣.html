    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form is <span class="kanji-inline">獸</span>, a compound in which <span class="kanji-inline">罾</span> is combined with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a>. Within <span class="kanji-inline">罾</span>, the upper element <span class="kanji-inline">單</span> depicts an oval hunting shield adorned with twin feather pennants, while the lower “sai” represents a covenant vessel that held written petitions to the deities—together evoking the rite of praying for success before setting out to hunt. With the addition of the hunting dog <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a>, the graph came to signify the act of the hunt itself. In oracle-bone inscriptions <span class="kanji-inline">獸</span> is used for “to hunt,” and only later did its sense shift to the quarry—the beast or game taken—whereupon the phono-semantic character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="狩.html">狩</a> was created to write the verb “to hunt.”</p>
