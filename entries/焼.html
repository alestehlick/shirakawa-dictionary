    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">燒</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the fire element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="火.html">火</a> gives the meaning, while <span class="kanji-inline">堯</span> serves as the sound element, as in characters like <span class="kanji-inline">繞</span>. Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">堯</span> as depicting clay vessels (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a>) stacked within a cooking stove or kiln (<span class="kanji-inline">焼</span><span class="kanji-inline">竈</span>). With the addition of fire, the graph shows those vessels being fired. From that concrete scene of firing pottery, the sense broadened to applying flame in general—“to burn”—and by extension to culinary heating such as baking and cooking.</p>
