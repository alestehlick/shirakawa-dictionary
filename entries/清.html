    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">清</span> is a phono-semantic character. Its original form <span class="kanji-inline">淸</span> pairs the water element with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="青.html">青</a>, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="青.html">青</a> serving as the phonetic that signals the on reading sei. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="青.html">青</a> names a blue‑green color once derived from cinnabar, a tone felt to be pure and tranquil. As the Shuowen says, the graph means “to become clear,” depicting water that has settled and turned limpid. From this image come senses such as water becoming clear (sumu), to clear or purify (kiyomeru), and, by extension, clarity and purity in a person or feeling—kiyoi, kiyoraka, akiraka.</p>
