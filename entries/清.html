    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound, originally written <span class="kanji-inline">淸</span>, with the water element providing the semantic field of water and liquids, and <span class="kanji-inline">青</span> supplying the sound sei while also evoking a calm blue‑green hue associated with purity and quiet. The Shuowen defines it as “becoming clear,” and understands the graph as depicting limpid, settled water. From the idea of water clearing, the sense extends to people, feelings, and conduct, yielding meanings such as pure, clean, to purify, and to be or make clear.</p>
