    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">轄</span> as a phono‑semantic compound: the vehicle element <span class="kanji-inline">車</span> indicates the setting, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="害.html">害</a> serves as the sound marker, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="割.html">割</a> (katsu). The original image is a wedge passed through one side of a wheel to keep it from slipping off—literally the chock that secures the axle. He suggests that choosing <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="害.html">害</a> hints at the creaking sound the wedge makes as the wheel turns. An old expression <span class="kanji-inline">轄</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="撃.html">撃</a> evokes the clacking of these wedges when many carts meet, later used as a metaphor for a teeming city. From naming the wedge that holds the wheel fast, the character broadened to mean tightening down, managing, and policing—hence the senses of control and jurisdiction.</p>
