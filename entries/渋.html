    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa traces this character to an older graph read ju that sets a <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a> “footstep” and its inverted counterpart—here understood as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刃.html">刃</a>, an upside‑down form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a>—face to face. Two feet confronting one another cannot move forward, which gives the sense of hanging back or being at a standstill, as felt in words like jutai, “congestion.” With the addition of the water element, it depicts progress hindered by water, and this idea of resistance was extended to taste: something shibui is puckery, reluctant to go down the throat. In Japanese, shibu also names the tannic “persimmon juice” used for dyeing and waterproofing.</p>
