    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">遲</span>, this is a phono-semantic character. In oracle-bone and bronze forms the phonetic element appears as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="屋.html">屋</a>, which Shirakawa reads as depicting a person being punished from behind with the barbed branding needle <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辛.html">辛</a>. When the movement element <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> (“to go, to walk”) is added, the whole graph pictures movement hindered—walking with difficulty—and thus comes to mean slow, late, to fall behind. Related characters in the same sound series include <span class="kanji-inline">墀</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">穉</span>. The Book of Odes (Bei Feng, Gu Feng) preserves the sense in a line that speaks of going “slowly, slowly” (chichi), an onomatopoeic evocation of a heavy, dragging gait.</p>
