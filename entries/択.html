    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">擇</span>, this is a phono‑semantic character: the hand on the left shows the act of handling, while the phonetic on the right is <span class="kanji-inline">睪</span> (eki). In ancient forms <span class="kanji-inline">睪</span> depicts an animal’s corpse—eyes (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="目.html">目</a>) above and the limbs (rendered by the element later shaped like <span class="kanji-inline">幸</span>) below. With the hand added, the graph pictures picking through a carcass that wind and rain have scattered, taking only the usable parts; from this concrete scene it comes to mean to choose, to select. The same phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">睪</span> signals the on‑reading, as in <span class="kanji-inline">鐸</span> (taku, “great bell”), and a related graph <span class="kanji-inline">釈</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">釋</span> portrays the scattering and undoing of a corpse with an animal’s claw.</p>
