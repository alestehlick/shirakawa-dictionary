    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Star is a phono-semantic character. The lower part, <span class="kanji-inline">生</span>, serves as the phonetic, giving the on-yomi sei. In early forms the upper element was written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="晶.html">晶</a>, a cluster of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a> marks that here do not depict the sun but stars, conveying the glittering brilliance of many lights in the night sky. From this vivid image, the character came to mean “star.” Classical verse already names specific stars: the Book of Odes mentions the Weaver Star (Vega, <span class="kanji-inline">織</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a><span class="kanji-inline">星</span>) and the Big Dipper. Astronomical lore about planetary movements, especially Jupiter, was enriched by knowledge from the western regions; terms such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="赤.html">赤</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奮.html">奮</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="若.html">若</a> (for the year when Jupiter stood in the direction of <span class="kanji-inline">丑</span>) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="摂.html">摂</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="提.html">提</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="格.html">格</a> (for <span class="kanji-inline">寅</span>), and the designation <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="歳.html">歳</a><span class="kanji-inline">星</span> “year star” for Jupiter itself, are phonetic transcriptions ultimately deriving from southwestern Asia and Egypt.</p>
