    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines the bird graph <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span> with the tree <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>. In its ancient form it shows many birds alighting on a tree, vividly expressing the idea of gathering. Early bronze inscriptions, such as the Mao Gong Ding, already use <span class="kanji-inline">集</span> in contexts like the phrase “<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="唯.html">唯</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="天.html">天</a><span class="kanji-inline">將</span><span class="kanji-inline">集</span><span class="kanji-inline">厥</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a>,” where it carries the sense of bringing things together to fruition, as when Heaven’s mandate is realized. Shirakawa further sees an echo of bird divination: affairs were decided by observing how flocks gathered and dispersed, so the graph came to suggest both the act of assembling and the settling or fulfillment of matters. In early texts <span class="kanji-inline">集</span> also interchanged with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="就.html">就</a>.</p>
