    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines the shrine doors <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a> with the square <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>, which Shirakawa interprets not as a mouth but as sai, a ritual receptacle that held written covenants and prayers to the gods. Set before the double doors of a sacred enclosure, this vessel marks a formal act of petition: one stands at the gate to seek the deity’s will and receive a revealed answer. From this scene of inquiring after divine intent, the meaning naturally broadened to the general senses of asking, questioning, and making inquiries.</p>
