    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph formed from the roof radical and the element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="谷.html">谷</a> read yō. The roof depicts the covering of a mausoleum where ancestral spirits are revered. This <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="谷.html">谷</a> is not the ‘valley’ koku, but the yō seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="俗.html">俗</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="浴.html">浴</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="欲.html">欲</a>: an image of divine pneuma appearing above a sai, a covenant vessel into which written prayers to the gods are placed. In the mausoleum one offers this vessel and prays; <span class="kanji-inline">容</span> thus portrays the dim manifestation—the figure and form—of a deity hovering over it. From this vision arise the senses of appearance and state, and by extension the ideas of admitting and permitting—of letting something in.</p>
