    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its original form <span class="kanji-inline">區</span>, the character shows an enclosed, hidden sacred precinct within which three ritual ai vessels are set out—containers for written petitions to the gods. The image is of a secluded place of prayer where many such receptacles are lined up. From this ritual scene, related graphs arose: <span class="kanji-inline">欧</span> portrays raising the voice in supplication, and <span class="kanji-inline">殴</span> depicts striking the vessel to press one’s plea. Because prayer took place within a small, bounded enclosure, <span class="kanji-inline">區</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">区</span> came to mean a delimited section or ward, and by extension the act of marking off or apportioning space.</p>
