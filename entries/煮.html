    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">煮</span> as a phono-semantic graph: the fire element gives the sense of heating, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a> provides the sound. The underlying image for “boiling,” however, was originally expressed by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="庶.html">庶</a>, which portrays a pan set beneath a roof in a kitchen, with fire below—an unmistakable scene of cooking. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a>, by contrast, depicted a ritual earthen fence with buried charms, an image of warding and obstruction that rightly appears in characters such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遮.html">遮</a> “to block.” Because <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a> (zhe/sha) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="庶.html">庶</a> (shu/sho) are phonetically close, their forms were early on conflated—already visible in bronze inscriptions—and the graph with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a> over fire, <span class="kanji-inline">煮</span>, became the standard character for “to boil.” In <span class="kanji-inline">煮</span>, then, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a> chiefly marks the reading, while the act of boiling reflects the kitchen-and-pan imagery embodied in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="庶.html">庶</a>.</p>
