    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">織</span> is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">戬</span> as its phonetic. <span class="kanji-inline">戬</span> originally depicted a pike adorned with decorative streamers, treated as a marked sign, with red silk seemingly spread as ornament; the brilliance suggested by <span class="kanji-inline">熾</span> (“blazing”) resonates with this image. The character first meant “textile,” especially patterned cloth, as seen in a bronze inscription reading <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="賜.html">賜</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a><span class="kanji-inline">戬</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衣.html">衣</a>, “I present you with decorated garments,” which records the bestowal of designed textiles for ritual wear. In this sense, <span class="kanji-inline">戬</span> is the original written form of <span class="kanji-inline">織</span>. The dazzling patterned silks excavated at Mawangdui from the Han period give a vivid impression of such fabrics. From the notion of fine textiles and twilled silk, the word broadened to mean “to weave” and, by extension, the craft of weaving.</p>
