    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: the left side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a> points to thread and weaving, while the right-hand element was originally <span class="kanji-inline">囟</span>, the infant&#x27;s fontanel, drawn like a netted lattice and used here as the phonetic (shi); in later script it was simplified to a <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a>-like form. From the image of cloth with a fine, thin weave, the character came to denote what is delicate or minute, and by extension what is small or scant in quantity; applied to people or conduct, it could also describe what is base or vulgar.</p>
