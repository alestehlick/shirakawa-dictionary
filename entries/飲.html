    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its oldest form the character was written as <span class="kanji-inline">歆</span>, a compound that sets a covered wine vessel beside <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="欠.html">欠</a>, the figure of a person with mouth open. The vessel is the wine jar <span class="kanji-inline">酉</span> capped with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="今.html">今</a> as its lid, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="欠.html">欠</a> supplies the act of drinking. Together they picture drinking from a cask and thus give the meaning “to drink.” Later, a new graph <span class="kanji-inline">飲</span> was adopted that replaced the wine-jar element with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="食.html">食</a>, which originally depicted a lidded food container; although that component was not specific to liquids, this form came to be used for the sense “to drink” in place of <span class="kanji-inline">歆</span>.</p>
