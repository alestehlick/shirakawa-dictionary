    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">消</span> is a phono-semantic compound with the water element on the left and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肖.html">肖</a> as its phonetic. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肖.html">肖</a> originally depicts a small piece of meat pierced by a bone, suggesting something at the tip or end; in a tree it gives the sense found in <span class="kanji-inline">梢</span>, the treetop. With water added, the character pictures water sinking away and vanishing, and by extension came to mean to go out or be extinguished, to run out, and to put out. The same phonetic nuance appears in <span class="kanji-inline">悄</span>, where the heart weakens and droops, and in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">消</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="散.html">散</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">消</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="滅.html">滅</a> for things fading from sight, and <span class="kanji-inline">消</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="極.html">極</a> for a state of depleted energy or will.</p>
