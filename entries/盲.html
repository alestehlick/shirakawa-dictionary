    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">盲</span> is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">亡</span> supplying the sound. The form <span class="kanji-inline">亡</span> originally pictured the bones of a dead person with arms and legs drawn up; by loan it also came to carry the sense of “not, nothing.” The whole graph names one who has lost the use of the eyes—a blind person (meshii). The Shuowen glosses it as “eyes without pupils.” Related characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">瞽</span> also mean “blind,” and in antiquity titles like <span class="kanji-inline">瞽</span><span class="kanji-inline">史</span> referred to historiographers: many sightless people served as keepers of memory, reciting records, and were frequently found among ritual musicians and shamans.</p>
