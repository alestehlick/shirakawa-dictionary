    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: the left side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> gives the realm of words, while the right side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="己.html">己</a> supplies the on reading ki. Shirakawa links it to the cognate <span class="kanji-inline">紀</span>, where <span class="kanji-inline">糸</span> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="己.html">己</a> originally pictured thread neatly wound onto a spool—putting threads in order. When that idea is transferred from silk to speech, <span class="kanji-inline">記</span> comes to mean arranging words in good order and setting them down: to write, to note, to record. From there it also denotes what has been written—a document or account—and even the act of remembering. Because of this shared core of “ordering and setting down,” <span class="kanji-inline">記</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">紀</span> often interchange in compounds such as kisai, kijutsu, and kiroku.</p>
