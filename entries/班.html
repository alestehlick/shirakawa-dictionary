    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">班</span> is formed by combining <span class="kanji-inline">玨</span>—two jade pieces bound together—with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a>, the knife. <span class="kanji-inline">玨</span> evokes a paired, precious jade; adding the blade shows that jade being cut and apportioned. Early lexicons gloss it as dividing auspicious jade, and from this core image come senses of dividing and distributing, seen in terms like <span class="kanji-inline">班</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="給.html">給</a> (to allot) and <span class="kanji-inline">班</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a> (allotted fields). By extension, <span class="kanji-inline">班</span> became the word for a unit created by dividing people into working groups, as in <span class="kanji-inline">班</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="長.html">長</a>, the leader of such a group. The character also appears alongside <span class="kanji-inline">斑</span> in expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">班</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="白.html">白</a>, evoking variegation—the mingling of hues like those within a piece of jade.</p>
