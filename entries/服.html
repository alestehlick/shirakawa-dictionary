    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">服</span> is a phono-semantic character. The phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">艮</span>, which provides the sound value, depicts a kneeling figure being pressed down from behind by a hand, an image of bringing someone to submission. The other element, written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> here but standing for the component that underlies <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="盤.html">盤</a>, points to the ritual tray used in formal ceremonies. Together they express the act of conducting a prescribed rite before the vessel—most notably the rite that follows surrender. From the completion of such a ceremony arise the obligations of subjection (<span class="kanji-inline">服</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="属.html">属</a>) and the performance of attendant service (<span class="kanji-inline">服</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="事.html">事</a>), yielding core senses of “to submit, obey, comply,” and by extension “to carry out, serve, use,” alongside the later noun sense of “clothing.”</p>
