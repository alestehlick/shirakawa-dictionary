    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the original form is <span class="kanji-inline">境</span>, with <span class="kanji-inline">竞</span> (read kyo) as its phonetic. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">竞</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="音.html">音</a>, which in ancient ritual signifies the words offered in prayer before the altar—the answering sound being the gods’ visitation—with the figure of a person. <span class="kanji-inline">竞</span> thus depicts the presentation of those prayer-words; when a divine message arrives, the rite comes to an end, giving <span class="kanji-inline">竞</span> the sense of “to conclude.” Applied to land, this notion of an ending yields the idea of the place where a territory comes to an end—the boundary. By extension, <span class="kanji-inline">境</span> also denotes a particular situation or state.</p>
