    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a human head: the eyes indicate the face, and the hair is shown above. From this head motif, related graphs arose—<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="県.html">県</a> depicts a head hung upside down; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="導.html">導</a> evokes advancing while bearing the head of someone from another clan to wield ritual power that exorcises evil; and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="道.html">道</a> names the path purified by such rites. Because the head is the most vital part of the body, <span class="kanji-inline">首</span> naturally came to mean the leader or chief, and, esteemed as the foremost part, it further developed senses of “first” and “beginning.”</p>
