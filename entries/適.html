    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">適</span> is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">商</span> as its phonetic, giving the on reading teki. In Shirakawa’s view, <span class="kanji-inline">商</span> is composed of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="帝.html">帝</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">口</span>, the latter depicting sai, a sacred receptacle that held written prayers. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">商</span> thus evoked a person of rank qualified to recite prayers and officiate before the Supreme Deity, and it is also the original form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="嫡.html">嫡</a>. Against this religious background, <span class="kanji-inline">適</span> came to mean being in due conformity with required qualifications—meeting or measuring up to a standard, hitting the mark—whence senses seen in words like <span class="kanji-inline">適</span><span class="kanji-inline">格</span> (competency) and <span class="kanji-inline">適</span><span class="kanji-inline">正</span> (properness). From the idea of striking true and aiming toward a point, the character also extends to the sense of “to go.”</p>
