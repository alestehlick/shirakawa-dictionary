    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>適 is a phono-semantic character with 商 as its phonetic, giving the on reading teki. In Shirakawa’s view, 商 is composed of 帝 and 口, the latter depicting sai, a sacred receptacle that held written prayers. The graph 商 thus evoked a person of rank qualified to recite prayers and officiate before the Supreme Deity, and it is also the original form of 嫡. Against this religious background, 適 came to mean being in due conformity with required qualifications—meeting or measuring up to a standard, hitting the mark—whence senses seen in words like 適格 (competency) and 適正 (properness). From the idea of striking true and aiming toward a point, the character also extends to the sense of “to go.”</p>
