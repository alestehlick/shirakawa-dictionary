    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">語</span> is a phono-semantic character: <span class="kanji-inline">吾</span> supplies the on-reading go, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> provides the semantic field of speech. Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">吾</span> as the image of a sai, a covenant vessel that held written prayers to the gods, sealed with a wooden lid—hence a sense of prayer preserved and entrusted to the divine. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, for its part, shows the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辛.html">辛</a> needle used in punitive tattooing and signifies the solemn words of oath-taking before the gods at trials or treaties, where one accepts that needle’s punishment if the vow is broken. Against this backdrop, <span class="kanji-inline">語</span> originally evoked words addressed upward—prayerful, protective speech—standing in contrast to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> as more forceful, assertive utterance. From this core it broadened to mean words and language in general, and by extension “to tell, to relate,” as seen in compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a><span class="kanji-inline">語</span>.</p>
