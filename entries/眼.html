    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">眼</span> is a phono-semantic compound: the left side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="目.html">目</a> shows the eye, while <span class="kanji-inline">艮</span> serves as the sound indicator for gan/gen and also carries an image Shirakawa links to ritual power. He illustrates this with the related graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="限.html">限</a>, which depicts setting up an apotropaic eye before the gods’ ladder to heaven as a ward, a scene that makes intruders recoil and turn back. From this ritual backdrop, <span class="kanji-inline">眼</span> denotes the eye endowed with such potent, spellbinding force. In usage, manako names the central part of the eye, seen as the source of penetrating vision and the basis for expressions like ganriki or ganryoku, the power of sight.</p>
