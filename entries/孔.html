    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph of a child, with a distinctive curved stroke added at the back of the head as if the hair were shaved there. The mark points to the soft opening of an infant’s skull—the fontanel—reflected in expressions like kôketsu (<span class="kanji-inline">孔</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="穴.html">穴</a>). From this image it came to mean an opening or hole, and it also hints at an early childhood rite in which that spot carried ceremonial significance.</p>
