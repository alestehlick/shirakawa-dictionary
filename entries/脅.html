    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">脅</span> as a picto‑phonetic graph. Its upper element is the old “three‑plough” form—originally three <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a> modeled on the plough <span class="kanji-inline">耒</span>—symbolizing cooperative cultivation and serving as the phonetic that underlies the on‑reading kyo (the same element stands behind <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="協.html">協</a>). When this row‑like form is viewed as ribs and combined with the flesh classifier <span class="kanji-inline">月</span>, it becomes a body‑part graph: in <span class="kanji-inline">脇</span> it names the flank. In <span class="kanji-inline">脅</span>, with the same parts, it evokes drawing up the shoulders so the ribs stand out—an intimidating stance—and thus comes to mean to threaten or menace.</p>
