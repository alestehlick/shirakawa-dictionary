    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character. In bronze inscriptions, the element <span class="kanji-inline">壬</span> serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading tei, and depicts a person pouring libations to purify the earth deity, shown as a mound of soil set on a stand. The component <span class="kanji-inline">廴</span> portrays the wall that encloses and separates that ritual precinct. Together they designate a sacred court or yard where ceremonies were performed; by extension it came to mean the place where affairs of state were handled and trials conducted, hence also a government office.</p>
