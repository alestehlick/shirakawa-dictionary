    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa views <span class="kanji-inline">華</span> as a pictograph of a blossom at the moment of full efflorescence, petals flaring in all directions. From this radiant image come the senses of “flower” and, by extension, “splendor” and “gorgeousness.” He links this flower-form to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="拝.html">拝</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">拜</span>) as well: the character originally showed a person bending at the waist to pluck such a flower, a posture akin to a respectful bow, which led <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="拝.html">拝</a> to mean to pay reverence or implore. Later, the floral idea was recast in the phono-semantic character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="花.html">花</a>, built with the grass radical and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="化.html">化</a> as phonetic; this accounts for the on reading ka (matching the Chinese hua) while preserving the sense of “flower.”</p>
