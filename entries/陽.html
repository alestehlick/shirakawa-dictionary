    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the right-hand element, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="易.html">易</a>, supplies the reading yo and depicts a sacred jewel—written with the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>—set upon a stand, its sparkles streaming downward. Contact with that radiance was believed to quicken human vitality and make the waves of spirit flourish. The left element, <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span>, originally shows the divine ladder by which gods ascended and descended. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">陽</span> portrays a jewel placed before that ladder, a scene of divine authority. In later usage it came to denote the sun and its light and warmth, and by extension the sunny side of terrain—the south face of a mountain and the north bank of a river. It is also used as a loan for <span class="kanji-inline">佯</span>, “to feign, to deceive,” as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">陽</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="狂.html">狂</a> (feigned madness) and <span class="kanji-inline">陽</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> (lying words).</p>
