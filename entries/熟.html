    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa views <span class="kanji-inline">熟</span> as a phono-semantic character built on <span class="kanji-inline">孰</span> as its phonetic. The older form <span class="kanji-inline">孰</span> was created by adding the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丸.html">丸</a>, understood as the shape of a hand holding something, to a cooking vessel, giving the sense of cooking and serving as the original form of <span class="kanji-inline">熟</span>. Because cooking requires fire, the fire element was set below to produce <span class="kanji-inline">熟</span>, a more elaborate counterpart of <span class="kanji-inline">孰</span>. With <span class="kanji-inline">孰</span> already meaning to boil or cook, <span class="kanji-inline">熟</span> inherits that core sense and, from the idea of something cooked through, extends to ripeness and maturity, and by further extension to being brought to completion.</p>
