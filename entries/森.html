    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound ideograph built from three instances of the tree graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>. Brought together, the three trees express not a modest grove like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="林.html">林</a>—often a stand of trees near human settlements—but a broad, primeval expanse where trees grow thick and wild. Such deep woods were imagined as the dwelling place of deities, and in antiquity even <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="社.html">社</a> (shrine) could be read mori, “woods.” From this sense arises the compound <span class="kanji-inline">森</span><span class="kanji-inline">厳</span> (shingen), describing a solemn, awe‑filled atmosphere in which the presence of the gods can be felt.</p>
