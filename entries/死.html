    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph combining <span class="kanji-inline">歹</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="人.html">人</a>/<span class="kanji-inline">匕</span>. In early forms, <span class="kanji-inline">歹</span> was written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肖.html">肖</a>, a depiction of the remaining upper bones of a corpse. In ancient practice, bodies were first left in the brush; once the flesh had withered, the bones were gathered and buried—this is the original sense of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="葬.html">葬</a>, and the later “double funeral” (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="複.html">複</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="葬.html">葬</a>) reflects that rite. The character shows a person bowed in reverent mourning before the collected, abandoned bones, and from this funerary scene it came to mean death and to die.</p>
