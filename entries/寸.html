    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This graph combines the right hand (<span class="kanji-inline">又</span>) with a short stroke indicating a single finger, expressing the breadth of one finger of the hand. In traditional body-based measures, a shaku (<span class="kanji-inline">尺</span>)—shown as a hand with the thumb and middle finger spread and the wrist marked—was the span across the hand; <span class="kanji-inline">寸</span> is one tenth of a shaku and thus serves as a unit of length, about an inch. Because a finger’s breadth is small, the character also came to mean “a little.”</p>
