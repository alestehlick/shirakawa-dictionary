    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">緣</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a> “thread” points to textiles, while <span class="kanji-inline">彖</span> serves as the phonetic, indicating an early on-reading like tan. Its core meaning is the frilled edging or selvage of cloth—the decorative binding at a garment’s border. From that literal sense it broadened to any brim, edge, or surrounding margin, and then to the abstract idea of a connecting boundary—ties and relations between people and things, even karmic bonds—as seen in words like <span class="kanji-inline">縁</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="故.html">故</a>. The modern on-reading en appears to have been encouraged by association with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="沿.html">沿</a> “to run along,” since a hem lies along the edge. Classical usage preserves the textile setting: in the Zhou Rites, <span class="kanji-inline">縁</span><span class="kanji-inline">衣</span>, “fringed garments,” names one of the queen’s six ceremonial robes.</p>
