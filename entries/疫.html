    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the sickness radical <span class="kanji-inline">疒</span> sets the field of meaning as illness, while the phonetic is <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>—the hand-with-stick sign used for striking—here standing as the abbreviated form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="役.html">役</a> (eki). Because <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="役.html">役</a> carries the sense of going out or ranging far, the graph came to name a disease that spreads widely: an epidemic or prevailing sickness. In earlier times such outbreaks were attributed to the activity of malevolent spirits, and exorcistic rites were performed to drive them away.</p>
