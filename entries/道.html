    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph of <span class="kanji-inline">首</span> ‘head’ and <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> ‘to go.’ Bronze forms add <span class="kanji-inline">又</span> ‘hand,’ making explicit the act of advancing while holding a head. In ancient rite, the head of an enemy was believed to carry potent curse power that could drive off harmful spirits clinging to foreign soil; one moved forward bearing it to exorcize and purify the route. The related <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="導.html">導</a> combines head, movement, and hand (<span class="kanji-inline">又</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a>) and names the guiding advance that performs this purification, while <span class="kanji-inline">道</span> denotes the stretch thus cleared and sanctified as a usable way. Kindred graphs echo the same ritual logic: <span class="kanji-inline">除</span> shows a handled needle (<span class="kanji-inline">余</span>) thrust into the ground to expel spirits below, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="途.html">途</a> marks a path purified in that fashion. Over time, <span class="kanji-inline">道</span> broadened from a ritually cleansed roadway to the rational order or method of things (<span class="kanji-inline">道</span><span class="kanji-inline">理</span>), and in Japan it came to mean the disciplined arts (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="華.html">華</a><span class="kanji-inline">道</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="茶.html">茶</a><span class="kanji-inline">道</span>). In classical usage it can also mean ‘to speak.’</p>
