    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its older form <span class="kanji-inline">勸</span>, this is a picto-phonetic character built on <span class="kanji-inline">雚</span>, read kan and depicting the sacred stork, a bird consulted in divination, paired with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a>, here understood as the form of the plow <span class="kanji-inline">耒</span>. The graph evokes seeking the gods’ will through bird augury to learn the prospects of the harvest, then setting oneself to the work of cultivation in response. From this, the character came to express urging and encouraging others, as well as exertion and diligent effort. Over time its sense broadened to general “encouraging” or “recommending.” The same stork element appears in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="観.html">観</a>(<span class="kanji-inline">觀</span>), which points to observing the divine will through augury, and in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="歓.html">歓</a>(<span class="kanji-inline">歡</span>), which celebrates the joy of receiving a favorable answer to prayer.</p>
