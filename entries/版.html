    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">版</span> as a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="反.html">反</a> provides the phonetic cue for the on reading han, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="片.html">片</a> depicts a board—the plank set on either side in the tamped-earth wall-building technique called hanchiku (<span class="kanji-inline">版</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="築.html">築</a>). Archaeological remains at Zhengzhou, a Zhou-period capital, preserve a long stretch of such rammed-earth fortification, vividly recalling the paired boards that framed the fill. From this concrete implement arose the sense of “board,” and by extension the “printing block” or “plate.” In early usage, <span class="kanji-inline">版</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="板.html">板</a> were probably the same graph and were often used interchangeably for “board,” “placard,” and “printing block.”</p>
