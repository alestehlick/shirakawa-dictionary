    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">笑</span> as a pictograph of a miko—a female shaman—raising both hands, twisting her body, and dancing in ecstasy. It captures the posture used to appeal to and delight the gods, and from this ritual performance the character came to mean to laugh and to smile. The lower element is <span class="kanji-inline">夭</span> (yō), depicting a dancer with head inclined and body sinuously bent, while the upper part was later standardized as the bamboo crown <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="竹.html">竹</a>. He contrasts it with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="若.html">若</a>, which likewise portrays a shaman waving her hands to seek divine revelation in combination with a covenant vessel; in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="若.html">若</a> those waving hands settled into the grass radical <span class="kanji-inline">艹</span>, whereas in <span class="kanji-inline">笑</span> they became the bamboo crown. Early on the word was also written with the mouth radical as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="咲.html">咲</a>, a form that later specialized to mean “to bloom.”</p>
