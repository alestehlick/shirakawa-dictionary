    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The graph shows a large head set above <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>, the front-facing figure of a person with outstretched arms and legs. It first meant the head—the highest part of the human body—and from that sense of “what is above” it came to name the sky, hence heaven. Already in Shang times <span class="kanji-inline">天</span> was venerated as the divine realm; oracle-bone inscriptions call the Shang capital <span class="kanji-inline">天</span><span class="kanji-inline">邑</span><span class="kanji-inline">商</span>, “the sacred settlement of Shang.” A related character refers to the ground where the gods set their feet when descending and ascending by their ladder, the meeting place of heaven and earth. In the Zhou period the doctrine of the Mandate of Heaven cast dynastic change as Heaven’s decree, and so <span class="kanji-inline">天</span> came to signify the will of Heaven and whatever lies beyond human power; by extension it also names nature itself and what is inborn.</p>
