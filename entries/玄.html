    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">玄</span> as picturing the twisted ends of a thread. When the white, tied-off tips are plunged into a dye pot and repeatedly soaked, the thread darkens to a black with a reddish cast, a color that evokes depth and mystery. Classical sources say three immersions yield a pale red (<span class="kanji-inline">縷</span>), seven a full black (<span class="kanji-inline">緇</span>); <span class="kanji-inline">玄</span> sits just short of that, a red-leaning black—like a sixth soaking. From this chromatic nuance grew the aesthetic sense of yugen, so <span class="kanji-inline">玄</span> came to mean “deep, profound, calm.” The knot at the very tip preserves a trace of the original white, called <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="素.html">素</a>, which is why <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="素.html">素</a> itself names “white.”</p>
