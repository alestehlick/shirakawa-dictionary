    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">姿</span> as a phono-semantic character: <span class="kanji-inline">女</span>, “woman,” gives the sense, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="次.html">次</a> serves as the phonetic and in its oldest form depicts a person with mouth agape in lament. This value is echoed in <span class="kanji-inline">咨</span>, which combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="次.html">次</a> with a <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> component used in ritual graphs for a receptacle that holds written prayers, and thus signifies chanting, lament, and complaint addressed to the gods. Against this background, <span class="kanji-inline">姿</span> originally evoked the figure of a grieving woman—the posture and bearing shaped by lamentation—then broadened to mean one’s outward figure or pose, as in <span class="kanji-inline">姿</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="態.html">態</a>, the artful posture or allure.</p>
