    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In origin, <span class="kanji-inline">我</span> depicts a saw with a notched blade. Personal pronouns had no dedicated way to be written, so the graph was later borrowed phonetically to represent the first-person pronoun ware. To restore the concrete meaning of saw, the picto-phonetic character <span class="kanji-inline">鋸</span> was formed by adding the metal radical to <span class="kanji-inline">我</span>. The identification of <span class="kanji-inline">我</span> as a saw is supported by related graphs such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="義.html">義</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">羲</span>, which portray a sheep being cut with a saw for sacrificial offering: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="義.html">義</a> shows the act of offering the sheep to the gods, while <span class="kanji-inline">羲</span> shows the remaining hind legs of the sacrificial animal hanging down.</p>
