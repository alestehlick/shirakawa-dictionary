    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">驗</span>, this is a phono-semantic graph: the horse element supplies the scene of divination, while <span class="kanji-inline">僉</span> serves as the phonetic and links the word to other graphs like <span class="kanji-inline">檢</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="検.html">検</a>) and <span class="kanji-inline">險</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="険.html">険</a>) that share its on-reading. <span class="kanji-inline">僉</span> itself depicts two worshipers dancing in ritual, each presenting a container into which written prayers to the gods are placed. <span class="kanji-inline">験</span> thus names the moment when a response to such prayer is shown. The horse was chosen because it was thought especially quick to receive divine inspiration, and ceremonies that tested the gods’ will through horses were performed—Japan too held shrine horse races from ancient times. From this setting the character came to mean testing or trying something out, investigating, and, by extension, a manifest sign, proof, or the effective result of a prayer.</p>
