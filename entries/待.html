    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the left side <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span> suggests moving or proceeding—and by extension the passage of time—while the right side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寺.html">寺</a> serves as the phonetic and also evokes the idea of holding or sustaining a condition. Together they express keeping oneself in a poised state as time goes by, hence “to wait” and “to await,” and by extension “to prepare (for)” and “to treat/receive” others. Shirakawa further notes that this graph appears to have differentiated from an earlier form written like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="祉.html">祉</a>, which in oracle-bone inscriptions bore the value “shi” with the sense of “long,” and in bronze inscriptions the value “ku” with the sense “to go”; <span class="kanji-inline">待</span> then settled into the specialized notion of awaiting in readiness.</p>
