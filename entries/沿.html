    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the water element indicates the domain of streams and coasts, while the right-hand phonetic marks the On reading en and goes back to a sacred image. There, the divine pneuma appears above a ritual receptacle for petitions (sai), with the shape <span class="kanji-inline">八</span> showing the spirit’s descent. In the related graph <span class="kanji-inline">兌</span>, that spirit lightly comes down upon a shaman (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="祝.html">祝</a>) bearing the covenant vessel, bringing joy to the heart, and from this arises the sense of being in accord with the divine will. Transferred to water, the character comes to mean to go with, follow, or be in accordance with a course, and by extension the rim or edge—hence uses such as along the coast (<span class="kanji-inline">沿</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="海.html">海</a>).</p>
