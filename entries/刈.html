    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">刈</span> is a phono-semantic compound built on <span class="kanji-inline">乂</span>, which depicts crossed blades—scissors—and carries the idea of trimming or cutting. In antiquity <span class="kanji-inline">乂</span> was also used in the sense of bringing order and pacifying. By adding the knife element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a> to <span class="kanji-inline">乂</span>, the graph <span class="kanji-inline">刈</span> narrowed that broader sense to a concrete act of cutting, specifically the reaping and mowing of grass. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">乂</span> provides the sound (gai) and the notion of trimming, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a> firmly anchors the character in the realm of cutting with a blade.</p>
