    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">秩</span> as a phono-semantic character: the right-side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="失.html">失</a> serves as the phonetic element that marks the on reading (as in <span class="kanji-inline">帙</span>), while the character as a whole evokes things stacked in neat rows. The Shuowen glosses it as “a piled-up form,” and the Book of Odes line <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="積.html">積</a><span class="kanji-inline">之</span><span class="kanji-inline">秩</span><span class="kanji-inline">秩</span> vividly portrays sheaves set up tightly without gaps. From this image of regular piling came the senses of orderly arrangement and correct sequence, and by extension the order of rank in public office—hence terms like chitsuroku and chitsuho for stipends determined by rank.</p>
