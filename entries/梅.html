    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> “tree” provides the meaning, while <span class="kanji-inline">每</span> (in the usual form) or <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="某.html">某</a> (in the variant <span class="kanji-inline">楳</span>) supplies the sound. Early sources glossed <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="某.html">某</a> as a “sour fruit,” and in older graphic tradition <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="某.html">某</a> combined a covenant-receptacle shaped like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a> hung from a tree branch, a rite of dedicating petitions and consulting the divine will—a background that also underlies characters such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="謀.html">謀</a>. In <span class="kanji-inline">梅</span> this structure names the ume, the Chinese Japanese apricot. The tree reached Japan by the Nara period; the word was then read with the Chinese méi, which, with a prefixed vowel, became the native ume (and in the Heian era also mume). Plum blossoms were long cherished in China and Japan; the Man’yoshu preserves many poems praising their beauty, and their fragrance was once esteemed even above the cherry’s.</p>
