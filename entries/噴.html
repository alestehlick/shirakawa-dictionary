    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">噴</span> is a phono-semantic character: the mouth element signals an outward emission, while <span class="kanji-inline">賁</span> supplies the sound fun and an image. <span class="kanji-inline">賁</span> originally depicts flowers bursting open all at once—hence “beautiful,” but more essentially the idea of inner energy surging outward with force. Borrowing that dynamism, <span class="kanji-inline">噴</span> names the vehement outpouring of breath, steam, or fluid—the sudden spouting, spraying, or spewing from within. Early lexicographic notes also record senses such as getting angry, vomiting, and blowing, all aligned with this image of power erupting outward.</p>
