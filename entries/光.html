    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound of fire (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="火.html">火</a>) and person (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="人.html">人</a>/<span class="kanji-inline">儿</span>). In early forms, <span class="kanji-inline">儿</span> shows a kneeling human figure, above whose head a large flame is drawn to stress the presence of fire—built on the same principle as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="見.html">見</a>, which sets an enlarged eye on a person, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="先.html">先</a>, which places the form of footsteps atop a person. Because fire was sacred in antiquity, there were attendants charged with guarding and serving the divine flame; <span class="kanji-inline">光</span> originally depicts such a fire-keeper. The meaning then shifted to the light of the fire itself, and from the beauty of illumination it developed senses like “to shine, to sparkle,” which further extended to honor and distinguished glory, as seen in words such as <span class="kanji-inline">光</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="栄.html">栄</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">光</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="烈.html">烈</a>.</p>
