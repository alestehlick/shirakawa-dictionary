    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono‑semantic character: the semantic element <span class="kanji-inline">月</span> marks a body part, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="要.html">要</a> serves as the phonetic. In early forms, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="要.html">要</a> depicted a woman’s hipbones and originally named the waist itself. When <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="要.html">要</a> later took on the abstract sense of “pivot” or “essential,” a new graph was coined to retain the bodily meaning by adding the flesh classifier, producing <span class="kanji-inline">腰</span> for “waist.” This form was established during the Six Dynasties (third to sixth century CE).</p>
