    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats <span class="kanji-inline">捨</span> as a phonetic compound built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舍.html">舍</a>, which supplies the reading sha. In his account, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舍.html">舍</a> depicts a ritual act: a long-handled needle pierces the sai, a covenant vessel that held written petitions to the deity, thereby breaking the virtue of the prayer and nullifying its effect. With the hand element added on the left, <span class="kanji-inline">捨</span> shows the deliberate act of performing this piercing, and by extension the act of casting something off. From this ritual image the character broadened to its common sense “to throw away,” and further to notions of giving up, leaving out, and even allowing or forgiving—letting something go.</p>
