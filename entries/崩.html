    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">崩</span> is a phono-semantic character: the mountain radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="山.html">山</a> supplies the idea of cliffs and slopes, while <span class="kanji-inline">朋</span> serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading hou and evoking the deep, booming roar of a landslide. The Shuowen defines it as “a breaking mountain,” hence its core senses of collapsing, crumbling, and falling in. An Old Script form cited there includes the element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="自.html">自</a>, which Shirakawa understands as the ‘ladder of the gods,’ the means by which deities ascend and descend; this suggests that places marked by a mountain’s collapse were regarded as numinous. Against this backdrop, the honorific use of <span class="kanji-inline">崩</span> for the death of the Son of Heaven can be seen as likening that passing to the collapse of a sacred place.</p>
