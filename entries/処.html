    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form is <span class="kanji-inline">處</span>, combining <span class="kanji-inline">虎</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">几</span>. Here <span class="kanji-inline">虎</span> does not depict the animal itself but a person clad in a tiger skin, seated on a low stool (<span class="kanji-inline">几</span>) in solemn guise—a ritual posture assumed before battle to pray for victory. From this image of a disguised, composed figure sitting with dignity, the character came to mean “to be in a place.” Bronze inscriptions write phrases such as <span class="kanji-inline">處</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="宗.html">宗</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="室.html">室</a>, “to be in the ancestral hall,” which anchor the sense of dwelling or being present in a sacred precinct. From “to be (there)” it broadened to “the place where one is,” and further extended to actions related to arranging and settling things: to put or set in place, to handle or deal with matters, and to decide or fix a course.</p>
