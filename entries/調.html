    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">調</span> is a phono-semantic character: <span class="kanji-inline">言</span>, “speech/utterance,” supplies the semantic field, while <span class="kanji-inline">周</span> serves as the phonetic. In ancient forms <span class="kanji-inline">周</span> depicts a rectangular shield whose entire surface is carved with a beautifully ordered pattern. That image of elegant, all-over arrangement underlies the character’s core sense of bringing things into balance. Thus the Shuowen glosses <span class="kanji-inline">調</span> as “to harmonize,” seen in <span class="kanji-inline">調</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="和.html">和</a>, and by extension it came to mean the orderly setting of musical tones—tuning. From this base it naturally developed the senses “to adjust,” “to settle,” and “to put in order,” and in Japanese usage it also came to mean “to examine, investigate.” <span class="kanji-inline">周</span> also functions as the on-reading indicator for chō in related characters, reinforcing the reading of <span class="kanji-inline">調</span>.</p>
