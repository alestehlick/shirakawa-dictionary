    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, this character depicts the head of a sheep set above a mountain, a pictorial emblem of a revered peak. <span class="kanji-inline">岳</span> was an old appellation for the mountain now known as Songshan (<span class="kanji-inline">嵩</span><span class="kanji-inline">山</span>), in a region once inhabited by the Qiang (Jiang) people, who were pastoralists. Songshan’s tutelary deity was said to be Bo Yi, regarded as the founding ancestor of the Jiang clan (<span class="kanji-inline">姜</span>). The graphic fusion of sheep and mountain reflects the mythic view of the summit as a sacred domain of a sheep‑herding people. From this venerable graph, the character <span class="kanji-inline">獄</span> later arose as a phono-semantic formation with <span class="kanji-inline">岳</span> supplying the sound.</p>
