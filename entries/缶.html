    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">缶</span> began as a pictograph of a clay vessel. The fuller form <span class="kanji-inline">罐</span> pairs this vessel element with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">雚</span> to give the Sino-Japanese reading kan (Chinese guan) and was used for jars, pots, and even a well bucket. In modern writing the general-use character <span class="kanji-inline">缶</span> stands in place of <span class="kanji-inline">罐</span>, essentially the same vessel graph without its phonetic. In compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">缶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="詰.html">詰</a> “canned food,” where the container is metal, the metal-radical form <span class="kanji-inline">鑵</span> is sometimes employed; both <span class="kanji-inline">罐</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">鑵</span> function as phonetic stand-ins for the borrowed sound kan from English can.</p>
