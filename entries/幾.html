    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">幾</span> is a compound that marries the thread element <span class="kanji-inline">丝</span> (the early form of the later <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a>, representing a decorative thread) with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>, a ritual pike. In ancient usage this was a halberd adorned with fixed streamers of thread, a weapon endowed with the power to ward off malign forces and used when probing suspicious or uncanny happenings. From watching for subtle hints and inquiring into them, the graph came to suggest faint indications and portents—signs that something is about to begin—and by extension the sense of ‘faint, dim.’ Its original nuance was that of critical scrutiny and questioning (as in the notion later expressed by the pairing of <span class="kanji-inline">譏</span> ‘to censure’ and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="察.html">察</a> ‘to examine’). Over time the character also took on its familiar interrogative use, asking quantity in ‘how many’ or ‘how much.’</p>
