    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">帥</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="自.html">自</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">巾</span>. The upper part is not the &#x27;meat&#x27; element seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="師.html">師</a> but rather approximates the single-leaf <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戸.html">戸</a> found in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="啓.html">啓</a>, evoking the one-panel door of a household shrine. The character thus depicts a cloth being applied to wipe and purify those shrine doors—a scene of ritual cleansing. From this act of presiding over purification arose the sense of standing at the head and leading, hence &#x27;commander&#x27;; the graph is also used in place of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="率.html">率</a>, carrying the meanings &#x27;to lead&#x27; and, by association, &#x27;to follow.&#x27;</p>
