    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">淑</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water element sets the field of meaning, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="叔.html">叔</a> serves as the phonetic, signaling the on-reading shuku. The Shuowen glosses it as water turning crystal-clear, and from that image it came to describe moral and aesthetic clarity—goodness, modesty, and a gentle, beautiful bearing. In bronze inscriptions, this same word is at times written with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="弔.html">弔</a>, a pictograph of a bow with a coiling retrieval cord (<span class="kanji-inline">繳</span>, shaku) used to ensnare game. Because the sound of <span class="kanji-inline">繳</span> (shaku) is close to that of <span class="kanji-inline">淑</span> (shuku/shū), <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="弔.html">弔</a> functioned as a loan graph for <span class="kanji-inline">淑</span>. This loan use underlies expressions like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="不.html">不</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="弔.html">弔</a> in the Odes, where it conveys “not blessed, unfortunate,” that is, not favored by Heaven.</p>
