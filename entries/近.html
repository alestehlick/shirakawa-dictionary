    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its old forms <span class="kanji-inline">近</span> brings together <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a>, the mark of a foot or step, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斤.html">斤</a>, a sacred broadax. The graph is phono-semantic: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斤.html">斤</a> supplies the on reading kin and at the same time names the ritual implement. Shirakawa sees the scene as a ceremony akin to that in <span class="kanji-inline">往</span>: one touches the consecrated axe with the foot and then departs, thus setting out endowed with its spiritual power. The royal territory encircling the capital was called <span class="kanji-inline">圻</span>, the sphere where this rite of <span class="kanji-inline">近</span> was observed, and from that context the character came to mean what lies “near” the capital in distance; later the idea of nearness naturally extended to time as well.</p>
