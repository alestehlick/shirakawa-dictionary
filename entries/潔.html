    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats <span class="kanji-inline">潔</span> as a phono-semantic character built on <span class="kanji-inline">絜</span> (ketsu) as its phonetic. The underlying graph evokes a thread ornament used in worship—finely split hemp bound into bundles like white hair—prepared by thinly cutting with a knife (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a>). Because such ornaments were employed in rites of purification, the base graph carried the sense of purifying. With the water element added, <span class="kanji-inline">潔</span> specifies purification by washing, hence “to cleanse, to purify,” and by extension “pure, clean,” which in Japanese usage also shades into the forthright, stainless quality expressed by isagiyoi.</p>
