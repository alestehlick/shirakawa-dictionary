    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">憂</span> as a compound graph that brings together the original form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="慕.html">慕</a> with <span class="kanji-inline">夊</span>, the sign of a backward footstep, and an element written <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span> that depicts a ceremonial headcloth—here the mourning badge worn on the head. The whole draws a picture of a mourner halted in grief, standing still and absorbed in lamentation with the insignia of mourning in place. From that image arise its senses of grieving, sorrow, worry, suffering, and mourning. Related graphs reflect the same scene: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="優.html">優</a>, with the person radical added, first evoked one devoted to mourning and grief and then, by extension, someone who reproduces that bearing in imitation; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寡.html">寡</a> shows a person wearing the mourning badge while reverently lamenting before the numinous, and so came to mean a widow; <span class="kanji-inline">擾</span> portrays the loss of composure that sorrow brings. The character’s meanings thus grow from the solemn, motionless posture of ritual mourning.</p>
