    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph of a pair of hinged leaves forming a double door. As the ancient Explanation of Names notes, men means to push, conjuring a doorway that opens by being pushed. From the concrete sense of a gate or entrance, the word naturally expanded to signify the house that has that entrance, and then, by association, the family or kin who live within. In contrast, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戸.html">戸</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">戶</span>) depicts a single swinging door.</p>
