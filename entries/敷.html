    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character. Its base form shows hands holding a young tree with its root, the act of setting a sapling into the ground. In bronze inscriptions that base appears in phrases such as “to spread orders” and “to extend government” (<span class="kanji-inline">專</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a>・<span class="kanji-inline">專</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="政.html">政</a>), and even adverbially as “widely, greatly,” and it is taken as the source of both <span class="kanji-inline">敷</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">溥</span>. With the addition of the ‘strike’ element (<span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>), indicating the tamping of soil, <span class="kanji-inline">敷</span> evokes planting a sapling and firming the earth. From that image it developed the senses “to lay, to spread out,” “to carry out,” and “to extend broadly,” like governmental commands being propagated far and wide.</p>
