    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">案</span> is a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="安.html">安</a> serves as the phonetic, signaling the on reading an, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>, placed not at the side but as a supporting base, supplies the concrete image. It originally named a wooden stand for setting things upon—a table or desk. In early usage a stand with legs was called <span class="kanji-inline">案</span>, and a low, legless tray was <span class="kanji-inline">槃</span>. As such stands came to hold books for study, planning, and examination, the character naturally broadened to mean the act of considering and devising ideas.</p>
