    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">弐</span> is the modern form of <span class="kanji-inline">貳</span>, a phono-semantic graph. In the ancient character, a halberd (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>) is applied to the inscription on a bronze ritual vessel, indicating the act of scraping and rewriting—altering the original text. From this image of making a second version came the senses “again” and “two,” and by extension “a duplicate copy.” In contemporary practice it survives as the formal numeral in sums such as <span class="kanji-inline">弐</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="万.html">万</a><span class="kanji-inline">円</span> to guard against tampering. It also appears in words that express going against what should stand—disobedience, divergence, or a divided heart—as in <span class="kanji-inline">弐</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="過.html">過</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">弐</span><span class="kanji-inline">志</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">弐</span><span class="kanji-inline">心</span>.</p>
