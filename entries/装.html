    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">裝</span>, this is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">壯</span> (read sō) serving as the phonetic element. Its basic sense is to arrange the outward appearance by means of clothing—hence to dress or adorn. From that core meaning it broadens into contexts beyond garments: in <span class="kanji-inline">装</span><span class="kanji-inline">甲</span> it is the act of putting on armor or plating; in <span class="kanji-inline">表</span><span class="kanji-inline">装</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">装</span><span class="kanji-inline">潢</span> it denotes the mounting and binding of paintings or calligraphy; and in <span class="kanji-inline">装</span><span class="kanji-inline">釘</span>・<span class="kanji-inline">装</span><span class="kanji-inline">訂</span>—now commonly written <span class="kanji-inline">装</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丁.html">丁</a>・<span class="kanji-inline">装</span><span class="kanji-inline">幀</span>—it refers to preparing a book’s cover and outward form. The compound <span class="kanji-inline">装</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="束.html">束</a> originally meant preparing for a journey, and later came to mean setting one’s attire in proper order.</p>
