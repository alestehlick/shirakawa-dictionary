    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">裂</span> is a phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="列.html">列</a> supplying the on-reading retsu and evoking the idea of violent severing—originally the brutal separation of head and body. Combined with the cloth element, the character focuses that force on fabric: not a neat cut with scissors, but a fierce rending into pieces. From this image it broadened to the general senses “to tear” and “to split” (saku, sakeru). The same notion of being pulled apart lies behind the term <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="車.html">車</a><span class="kanji-inline">裂</span>, the ancient punishment in which a body was bound to carts driven in opposite directions and torn limb from limb.</p>
