    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character originally depicts thin slices of meat laid out to dry in the sun. On that shape it became the graphic base for <span class="kanji-inline">腊</span>, “preserved meat,” formed by adding the meat classifier <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> to create a phono-semantic compound. By loan, <span class="kanji-inline">昔</span> then came to express temporal relations that are hard to picture—“long ago,” “for a long time,” and even “yesterday,” as seen in <span class="kanji-inline">疇</span><span class="kanji-inline">昔</span> (“once; formerly”). This same reliance on phonetic borrowing underlies conventional pairings like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="今.html">今</a> (kon/kin, “now”) and <span class="kanji-inline">昔</span>, familiar in expressions such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="今.html">今</a><span class="kanji-inline">昔</span>.</p>
