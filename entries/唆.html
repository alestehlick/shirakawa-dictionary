    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">唆</span> is a phono-semantic character formed with the mouth element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>, signaling speech, and the component <span class="kanji-inline">夋</span> as the phonetic. The phonetic value appears in related graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">梭</span> (sa, a weaver’s shuttle), indicating the on reading sa here. From the idea of working on someone with words, the character came to mean coaxing or instigating a person; Shirakawa notes that this sense likely preserves an onomatopoetic echo of the cajoling sounds of urging speech, reflected in the verb sosonokasu.</p>
