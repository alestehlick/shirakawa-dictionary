    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">准</span> is a phono-semantic character originally written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="準.html">準</a>, with <span class="kanji-inline">隼</span> serving as the phonetic element that points to the on reading jun. In early administrative usage it denoted the imperial act of granting permission—the<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="裁.html">裁</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="可.html">可</a> bestowed by the Son of Heaven. The process of submitting a memorial and receiving approval was first called <span class="kanji-inline">制</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="可.html">可</a>, and later the granting itself came to be expressed with set phrases such as <span class="kanji-inline">准</span><span class="kanji-inline">允</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">准</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奏.html">奏</a>, both built on <span class="kanji-inline">准</span> in the sense of “to allow.” This core meaning continues in modern compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">批</span><span class="kanji-inline">准</span>, the formal ratification a state gives when concluding a treaty.</p>
