    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the earliest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">兄</span> is a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> and a person. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> is not a mouth but the sacred container that held written prayers and covenant texts. The figure shows a person in profile bearing this vessel on the head—an image of someone engaged in worship. Because within the family the eldest brother presided over ancestral rites, the graph naturally came to mean “elder brother.” Early variants even add sleeve ornaments used in ritual dance or depict a kneeling posture, underlining this liturgical role. When the altar sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a> is added to <span class="kanji-inline">兄</span>, it yields <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="祝.html">祝</a>, the ritual officiant (hafuri), further confirming the character’s origin in sacred service.</p>
