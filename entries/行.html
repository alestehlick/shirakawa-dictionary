    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph of a crossroads—broad thoroughfares intersecting. As the place where people pass, it first conveyed the idea of “to go.” Crossings were also imagined as points where spirits move about, and so they became sites for ancient rites and magical practices, including beguiling arts and displays of skill. From the basic sense of going, the meaning widened to action in general, giving rise to uses such as “to conduct” and “to perform.”</p>
