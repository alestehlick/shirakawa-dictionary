    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">嫡</span> as a phono-semantic compound. Its phonetic core is <span class="kanji-inline">啇</span> (teki), a graph that originally joined <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="帝.html">帝</a>—the great altar used to worship the Heavenly Emperor—with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> understood here as a sai, a covenant vessel that held written petitions to the gods. In the ancient forms this composition points to the great ancestral rite <span class="kanji-inline">禘</span>, the worship of the Heavenly Emperor. Because only those in the direct line were permitted to perform the <span class="kanji-inline">禘</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="祭.html">祭</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">啇</span> came to signify an heir or successor. With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a> added as the semantic element, the character turns to matters of household status: the principal, lawful wife and, by extension, the legitimate heir. In this way <span class="kanji-inline">嫡</span> preserves the religious authority of the ancestral rite while expressing rightful succession within the family.</p>
