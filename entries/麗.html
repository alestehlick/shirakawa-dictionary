    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, this character shows deer antlers set out in a row. A deer&#x27;s paired antlers were regarded as something strikingly beautiful, so the graph came to mean “beautiful, elegant.” From the same image arises the nuance of things standing in a row or side by side. The simple form <span class="kanji-inline">丽</span> is the original graph, later serving as the upper component of <span class="kanji-inline">麗</span>. The related character <span class="kanji-inline">儷</span> preserves the sense of “to stand in a pair,” and in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">伉</span><span class="kanji-inline">麗</span> it refers to a husband and wife.</p>
