    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">獨</span>, this is a phono-semantic graph: <span class="kanji-inline">犭</span> marks the animal realm, while <span class="kanji-inline">蜀</span> supplies the sound and also depicts a male beast, with the inner <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="虫.html">虫</a> element drawn to suggest the genital organ. Because male animals are apt to range apart from the herd, the figure naturally came to express being set off by oneself, a sense later applied to people as “alone” or “oneself.” The phonetic force of <span class="kanji-inline">蜀</span> is seen in other graphs as well, such as the “bow-case” character read toku. By loan, <span class="kanji-inline">独</span> also came to mean “only,” sometimes standing in for characters like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="特.html">特</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="徒.html">徒</a>, hence the kun reading tada.</p>
