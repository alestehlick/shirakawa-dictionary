    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its oldest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">幸</span> depicts a pair of hand shackles, a penal device that fastens both wrists. Related characters preserve this image: in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="執.html">執</a> (“to seize”), the shackle secures both hands, and in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="報.html">報</a> (“to requite”), a kneeling figure is pressed down from behind, with bound hands indicated by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a> (“hand”). Against this backdrop, <span class="kanji-inline">幸</span> came to mean saiwai—good fortune—as in the idea of being spared a harsher penalty: to get off with shackles alone is <span class="kanji-inline">僥</span><span class="kanji-inline">倖</span>, an unexpected stroke of luck. From that sense of reprieve and relief grew the broader meanings of happiness and blessed good fortune.</p>
