    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the heart element signals feelings and inner disposition, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貫.html">貫</a> supplies the sound kan and the image of piercing or threading—originally shells strung together—hence the ideas of going through, being connected, and continuing over time. From this sense of something running through and lasting, the character comes to express the heart settling into familiarity: to grow used to, to make accustomed. The ancient lexicon also glosses it as “to learn, to train,” linking nareru (to get used to) with narau (to learn) as related stages of practiced familiarity.</p>
