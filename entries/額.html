    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: the head radical <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span> shows that the word concerns the head or brow, while the phonetic element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="客.html">客</a> (also written with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="各.html">各</a>) supplies the sound. Early lexica already gloss it as the forehead. In the Book of Documents, the reduplicated form <span class="kanji-inline">額</span><span class="kanji-inline">額</span> depicts an incessant, almost bobbing busyness—like nodding as one moves about. Because the forehead is the most prominent part of the face, the graph naturally broadened to refer to the prominent nameboard or plaque set at the very front of a building, a meaning that underlies its later senses of a framed tablet or frame.</p>
