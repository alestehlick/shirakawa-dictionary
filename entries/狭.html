    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">狹</span>, this is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">夾</span> as its phonetic. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">夾</span>, which gives the On reading kyo, depicts a person carrying another under both arms and thus conveys the idea of holding something between, of being pressed from both sides. When the animal classifier is added, the scene shifts to the mountains: an animal track so tight it can hardly be called a road. From this image of a constricted path, the character came to mean narrow (semai), to narrow or contract (sebameru, sebamaru), and by extension cramped or confining.</p>
