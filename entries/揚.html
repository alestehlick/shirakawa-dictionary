    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono‑semantic character: the hand on the left shows the act, while the right side (<span class="kanji-inline">易</span>) supplies the sound. Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">易</span> as the image of a spiritually potent jade set upon a stand, its brilliance streaming downward. Bronze forms often depict hands lifting such a jade, for contact with its radiance was thought to quicken human vitality and stir the spirit (tamafuri). In bronze inscriptions it appears in phrases like <span class="kanji-inline">對</span><span class="kanji-inline">揚</span><span class="kanji-inline">王</span><span class="kanji-inline">休</span>, “to respond to the king’s favor,” reflecting the idea of answering a benefaction. From the scene of holding up the jade, the character naturally developed the senses “to raise” and “to rise.”</p>
