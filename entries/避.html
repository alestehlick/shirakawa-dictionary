    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">避</span> is a phono‑semantic character formed with the road element and the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">辟</span>. Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">辟</span> as built from the side view of a person (<span class="kanji-inline">尸</span>) and a curved knife (<span class="kanji-inline">辛</span>), evoking a punitive act in which flesh was cut from the waist—the graph even suggesting the severed piece itself. From this base, <span class="kanji-inline">僻</span> (“to lean, to be askew”) pictures a body no longer able to stand straight, a twist like the motion one makes when dodging. With the road/path element added, <span class="kanji-inline">避</span> takes on the sense of veering aside on the way—sidestepping, taking a detour, keeping clear. In later usage it broadens to general ideas of avoidance, evasion, and drawing back.</p>
