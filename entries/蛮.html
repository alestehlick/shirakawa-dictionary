    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">蠻</span>, this is a phono‑semantic character: the phonetic part signals the sound ban, while its early form drew on a ritual image. In bronze inscriptions the graph without the insect component was used for this word, and its core depicted a covenant receptacle into which the words of an oath to the gods were placed, adorned with thread decorations—hence the presence of the silk element <span class="kanji-inline">絲</span> in the old form. The sense “southern savage” arose as a loan on the basis of that sound value; later, the insect/snake element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="虫.html">虫</a> was added because southern peoples were imagined as serpent‑like tribes. By contrast, northern non‑Chinese groups were called <span class="kanji-inline">狄</span>. From this background the character came to be used for ideas such as roughness, wildness, and uncivilized behavior.</p>
