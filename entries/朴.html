    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">朴</span> is a picto-phonetic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> “tree” supplies the semantic field, while <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span> cues the On reading boku. The Shuowen defines <span class="kanji-inline">朴</span> as the bark of a tree, rooting the graph in the notion of unworked, natural wood. From this base it came to express plainness and unaffected simplicity, as in compounds like soboku and junboku. The fuller form <span class="kanji-inline">樸</span> is glossed in the Shuowen as wood material—raw timber—and is often used interchangeably with <span class="kanji-inline">朴</span> to convey the same sense of basic, unadorned nature. In Japanese, <span class="kanji-inline">朴</span> also names the ho (ho-no-ki), Magnolia hypoleuca, preserving the image of straightforward, natural wood.</p>
