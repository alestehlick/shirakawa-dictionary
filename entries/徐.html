    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">徐</span> is a picto-phonetic character built from <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, the step/radical of going (the left half of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a>, a crossroads), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a> as its sound element. The phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a>, also seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="除.html">除</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="叙.html">叙</a>, originally depicted a large handled needle used to lance a boil and drain pus and blood, bringing relief and relaxation. The same imagery extends to piercing the earth to dispel malevolent forces beneath the ground, ensuring roads are safe. Thus <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="途.html">途</a> names a road ritually purified, and <span class="kanji-inline">徐</span> describes passage along it becoming smooth and unimpeded. From this sense of easing and release, the character comes to mean “slowly,” “gently,” and “gradually.”</p>
