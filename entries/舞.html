    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">舞</span> is a compound graph of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="無.html">無</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">舛</span>. In its earliest form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="無.html">無</a> does not mean “nothing,” but depicts a person dancing, sleeves spread and adorned with decorative streamers. <span class="kanji-inline">舛</span> adds the image of feet turned outward, the stance of a dancer. Together they form the full figure of dance, giving the meanings mau and mai, “to dance.” Oracle-bone inscriptions frequently record the rain-invoking rite called <span class="kanji-inline">舞</span><span class="kanji-inline">雩</span>, reflecting the character’s origin in ceremonial dancing. From the idea of stirring the spirit through dance, it also appears in compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鼓.html">鼓</a><span class="kanji-inline">舞</span>, meaning to rouse or encourage.</p>
