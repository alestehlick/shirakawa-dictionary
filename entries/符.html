    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the bamboo classifier (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="竹.html">竹</a>) shows the material of early tallies, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="付.html">付</a> supplies the sound and evokes the act of handing something to another with the hand. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">符</span> came to mean an object given as a mark of authorization or proof—hence a tally, token, or sign. The Shuowen glosses it as a “tally.” In Han times, bamboo edicts about six sun in length were split and later matched; these paired pieces, called “bamboo-joint tallies” (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="竹.html">竹</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="節.html">節</a>), were made in identical form so that the piece held by a recipient served as proof when joined. For important purposes they were cast in bronze: in 1957 the bronze joint tallies of Lord Qi of È (<span class="kanji-inline">鄂</span><span class="kanji-inline">君</span><span class="kanji-inline">啓</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="節.html">節</a>) were unearthed—a vehicle tally and a ship tally—faithfully imitating the form of the bamboo originals.</p>
