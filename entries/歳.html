    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its oldest form, this character centers on the broadax element (<span class="kanji-inline">戊</span>). Later hands added the shapes of footprints (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a>) above and below the blade, which in the present form appear as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a> at the top and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="少.html">少</a> below, together forming <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="歩.html">歩</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">步</span>) alongside the ax. Originally, <span class="kanji-inline">歳</span> was the name of a ritual in which meat cut with a broadax was offered in worship. Because this ceremony was held once a year, it became a marker of the annual cycle, and the character came to mean “year” or “one year.” Historically, it served as the year-counting term in the Xia dynasty, was replaced by <span class="kanji-inline">祀</span> in the Yin (Shang), and by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="年.html">年</a> in the Zhou.</p>
