    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">唯</span> as a ritual compound: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> is not a mouth but a sai, the covenant receptacle into which prayers are placed, set before <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span>, the pictograph of a small bird. In archaic forms the bird alone can appear. Because birds were taken as divine messengers and employed in bird divination, the graph came to mean the gods’ assent—“just so; agreed”—to what was asked, which underlies its adverbial sense “certainly” and, by extension, “only.” The reduplicated <span class="kanji-inline">唯</span><span class="kanji-inline">唯</span> preserves a reverent “certainly,” akin to kashikomarimashita. Related characters echo this divinatory background: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="進.html">進</a> records advancing with the gods’ permission after omens; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="雇.html">雇</a> depicts consulting the deity’s will at the household altar door <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戸.html">戸</a>; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="顧.html">顧</a> expresses turning back in respectful regard for that will, with <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span> showing the head in ritual headdress; and <span class="kanji-inline">雖</span> adds <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="虫.html">虫</a>, an intrusive spirit, beneath the sai, turning a full assent into a qualified one, “although.” In literary openings, <span class="kanji-inline">惟</span> or <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="維.html">維</a> can also function as a solemn “this,” reflecting the same oracular tone.</p>
