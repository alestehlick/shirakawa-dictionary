    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">陷</span>, this picto-phonetic character places the mound/boundary radical beside a phonetic that supplies the on-reading kan. Its ancient image is of a deep, mortar-like pit into which a person has dropped from above, hence the sense to fall in and, by extension, to cause someone to fall in, to entrap. <span class="kanji-inline">阱</span> names such a falling trap for animals. In early sacred imagery, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="自.html">自</a> (in its archaic form) depicts the ladder by which the gods ascend and descend; in that setting, <span class="kanji-inline">陥</span>—seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">陥</span><span class="kanji-inline">阱</span>—refers to the pit excavated before the divine ladder to guard the sacred approach. A number of other characters with the same radical likewise portray measures for protecting this precinct: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="限.html">限</a> driving off bearers of the evil eye, <span class="kanji-inline">隈</span> setting up a ghost-head effigy, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="隣.html">隣</a> crucifying a trespasser to release a will-o’-the-wisp, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="隔.html">隔</a> marking off the space by placing a tripod vessel. <span class="kanji-inline">陥</span> thus belongs to this complex of boundary-guarding signs.</p>
