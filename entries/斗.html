    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">斗</span> began as a pictograph of a handled dipper or ladle. The Shuowen describes it as a pictograph with a handle and defines it as the unit equal to ten shō (with one shō about 1.8 liters). The related character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="升.html">升</a> depicts the act of scooping with a <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勺.html">勺</a> (ladle) and became the name of the amount taken with it; <span class="kanji-inline">斗</span> then named the larger measure and, by extension, the act of measuring by the dipper, seen in terms such as <span class="kanji-inline">斗</span><span class="kanji-inline">枡</span> (tomasu) and <span class="kanji-inline">枡</span> (masu) for a measuring box. Because the pattern of seven stars resembles a dipper, the constellation of the Great Bear came to be called the Great Dipper, echoing the character’s original image.</p>
