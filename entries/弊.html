    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">敝</span>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幣.html">幣</a> (hei)—the shape of the ceremonial apron—serves as the phonetic and also evokes the ritual object itself, while <span class="kanji-inline">攵</span> (boku, “to strike”) adds the idea of action. Together they picture the apron being battered through use until it is frayed and damaged. The Shuowen glosses <span class="kanji-inline">敝</span> as “to fall prostrate,” even of an animal fallen in death; understood through <span class="kanji-inline">敝</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">弊</span> expresses collapse from fatigue and states of being torn or worn out, hence senses such as to fall, to grow tired, and to be tattered.</p>
