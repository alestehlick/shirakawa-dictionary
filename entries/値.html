    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph with the person element on the left and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="直.html">直</a> as the phonetic on the right, <span class="kanji-inline">値</span> takes its on-reading from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="直.html">直</a> (choku). Shirakawa notes that <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="直.html">直</a>, close to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="徳.html">徳</a> in sound and sense, evokes the idea of facing what is straight and essential. In early usage, as recorded in the Shuowen, the character means “to meet, to encounter; to see,” and it was used with that sense in expressions glossed as au. Later it was also written in place of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="直.html">直</a> to denote “price” and “value,” giving the modern Japanese senses ne and atai.</p>
