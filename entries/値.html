    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph with the person element on the left and <span class="kanji-inline">直</span> as the phonetic on the right, <span class="kanji-inline">値</span> takes its on-reading from <span class="kanji-inline">直</span> (choku). Shirakawa notes that <span class="kanji-inline">直</span>, close to <span class="kanji-inline">徳</span> in sound and sense, evokes the idea of facing what is straight and essential. In early usage, as recorded in the Shuowen, the character means “to meet, to encounter; to see,” and it was used with that sense in expressions glossed as au. Later it was also written in place of <span class="kanji-inline">直</span> to denote “price” and “value,” giving the modern Japanese senses ne and atai.</p>
