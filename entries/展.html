    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the oracle-bone and bronze forms, <span class="kanji-inline">展</span> is a compound: <span class="kanji-inline">尸</span> shows a body laid out, a second element depicts four stacked ritual implements used as apotropaic blocks, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衣.html">衣</a> marks the clothing at the neck. The graph pictures those protective implements being packed into the collar of a corpse to seal it against intrusive spirits. From rites of laying out and examining the dead (as in <span class="kanji-inline">展</span><span class="kanji-inline">屍</span>) and displaying sacrificial victims to assess their condition (<span class="kanji-inline">展</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犠.html">犠</a>), the sense broadened to spreading out, opening, and by extension to examining or investigating.</p>
