    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the old form <span class="kanji-inline">愼</span> sets the heart element beside <span class="kanji-inline">眞</span> as the sound. In <span class="kanji-inline">眞</span>, the graph combines the sign for a fallen dead person and an inverted hanging head, evoking someone struck by sudden calamity and lying dead in the street. Such a death was feared for the fierce power of its spirit, so the body was buried, a small shrine (<span class="kanji-inline">祠</span>) was set up, the deceased was respectfully placed within, a spirit-charged jewel (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="玉.html">玉</a>) was affixed, and rites of pacification (<span class="kanji-inline">鎭</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鎮.html">鎮</a>) were performed. <span class="kanji-inline">慎</span> expresses the sincere, restrained attitude with which one handles such a death—hence the sense of being prudent and careful.</p>
