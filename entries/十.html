    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>An indicative sign born from the old system of wooden counting rods: a single horizontal rod stood for “one,” while a single vertical rod marked “ten.” The character <span class="kanji-inline">十</span> records that vertical ten-sign. In bronze inscriptions the vertical stroke sometimes carries a thick dot at its center, a style that later yielded the form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a>. Higher decades were built additively from these rod signs—<span class="kanji-inline">廿</span> for “twenty” by aligning two tens, and “thirty” by combining three <span class="kanji-inline">十</span>. From this base arose administrative and counting usages such as <span class="kanji-inline">什</span>, denoting a unit of ten—ten people, ten poems, or ten households considered as one set—paralleling <span class="kanji-inline">伍</span> for a five-household unit.</p>
