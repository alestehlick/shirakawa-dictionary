    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="東.html">東</a> supplying the on reading tou. The Shuowen explains it as the munagi, the ridgepole—the timber that runs along the apex of a roof—and by extension it also means the roof ridge and, more broadly, a building. <span class="kanji-inline">梁</span> names the horizontal crossbeam that supports that ridge, and together <span class="kanji-inline">棟</span><span class="kanji-inline">梁</span> (ridge and beam) came to denote a leading figure in a group. The character also appears in compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="病.html">病</a><span class="kanji-inline">棟</span>, where it refers to a single building block or ward of rooms within a hospital.</p>
