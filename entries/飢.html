    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph built from the food element and the phonetic ki. The character is also written in the older form <span class="kanji-inline">饑</span>, which uses <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幾.html">幾</a> as the phonetic; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幾.html">幾</a> means few or scarcely any, sharpening the sense of having no food. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">飢</span> expresses hunger and starving. The component <span class="kanji-inline">几</span> is originally a pictograph of a small table; here it chiefly supplies the reading ki, yet its spare, skeletal outline can also call to mind the bone-thin state described as kotsuritsu, further coloring the idea of emaciation through lack of food.</p>
