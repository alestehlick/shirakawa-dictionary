    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In early script, <span class="kanji-inline">敏</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">每</span>—the figure of a woman with her hair done up and adorned—and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>, a hand. It pictures hands adjusting hair ornaments: the bustle of careful preparation for sacred rites. From this scene arose <span class="kanji-inline">敏</span>しむ, “to devote oneself to the rites,” and the sense in <span class="kanji-inline">敏</span><span class="kanji-inline">捷</span> of not neglecting one’s duties but moving with nimble energy. Hence the character came to mean to apply oneself, and by extension quick, agile, and, from the poised readiness of ritual action, clever and wise. A related note: the graph that gave rise to <span class="kanji-inline">捷</span> originally showed a woman with bound hair busily serving in the ancestral mausoleum, explaining its sense of “rapid.” When the thread element was added to <span class="kanji-inline">敏</span> and the form expanded, it produced <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="繁.html">繁</a>.</p>
