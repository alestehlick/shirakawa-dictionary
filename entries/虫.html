    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character now written as <span class="kanji-inline">虫</span> stands in place of the older <span class="kanji-inline">蟲</span>, which showed three instances of <span class="kanji-inline">虫</span> gathered together, evoking a swarm of small creatures. In the earliest forms, however, <span class="kanji-inline">虫</span> itself depicted a snake-like reptile—indeed even the pit viper—and belongs to the family of snake graphs: the snake sign can appear as <span class="kanji-inline">巳</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">它</span>, showing a snake with a large head, is the original graph behind <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="蛇.html">蛇</a>. Within this same sphere of imagery, <span class="kanji-inline">祀</span> points to the worship of a numinous natural deity, reflecting the sacred aura surrounding the snake sign. Shuowen glosses <span class="kanji-inline">虫</span> as the general name for <span class="kanji-inline">蟲</span>. Thus, while <span class="kanji-inline">虫</span> began as a serpent pictograph, <span class="kanji-inline">蟲</span> named the multitude of small crawling things; in later usage the single <span class="kanji-inline">虫</span> replaced <span class="kanji-inline">蟲</span> as the common character for “insect.”</p>
