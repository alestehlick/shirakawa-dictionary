    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A late compound graph combining the elements for person (<span class="kanji-inline">人</span>) and ox (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="牛.html">牛</a>), <span class="kanji-inline">件</span> does not appear in the earlier oracle-bone or bronze inscriptions and comes into use from the Tang–Song period. Although the motive for pairing these components is unclear, the character is firmly attested as a technical legal term: the Criminal Law section of the Jiu Tang Shu classifies offenses by count—“over twenty <span class="kanji-inline">件</span> is large, over ten <span class="kanji-inline">件</span> is medium.” From this role as a counter for discrete cases, <span class="kanji-inline">件</span> naturally came to mean an individual item or matter, and by extension a share used in sorting or apportioning things, as well as a passage or clause in a text—one segment among many.</p>
