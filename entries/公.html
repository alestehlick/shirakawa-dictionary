    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">公</span> began as a pictograph of the flat ceremonial precinct of the royal court. In early forms it depicts a level public square flanked by parallel walls, the place where state rites and business were conducted—ancestor worship, hearings and lawsuits, and other official affairs—before the palace and the ancestral mausoleum. From naming that precinct, the graph extended to mean the palace and ancestral domain, then the ruler who presides there, and finally what pertains to the public or the official as opposed to the private. Hence later moral nuances such as fairness and correctness, the impartial standard expected of a ruler, as reflected in words like gongping and gongzheng.</p>
