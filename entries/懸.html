    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">懸</span> is a phono-semantic compound. Its phonetic base <span class="kanji-inline">縣</span> (later <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="県.html">県</a>) originally pictured a head hung upside down from a tree by a rope, conveying the concrete act of hanging or suspending. When the heart component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a> was added, the sense extended from a physical suspension to a mind fastened onto something—concern that weighs on the heart, as in <span class="kanji-inline">懸</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="念.html">念</a>, a worried, lingering thought. Over time, <span class="kanji-inline">縣</span> came to denote an administrative district, while <span class="kanji-inline">懸</span> retained the older meaning of “to hang, to suspend.” The character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="係.html">係</a>, which depicts tying a decorative cord to a person and binding them, is close in sound and shares the core idea of fastening. In Japanese usage, <span class="kanji-inline">懸</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="想.html">想</a> evokes a heart attached to another—falling in love.</p>
