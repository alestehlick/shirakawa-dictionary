    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">衝</span> as a phono-semantic compound: the phonetic element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="重.html">重</a>, which also supplies the on-reading in characters like <span class="kanji-inline">踵</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="動.html">動</a>, is paired with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a>, the graph of a crossroads or roadway. The Shuowen glosses it as “to pass through a way,” and in practice it converges on the idea of force applied along a path. Closely related to <span class="kanji-inline">撞</span> “to ram,” <span class="kanji-inline">衝</span> depicts striking upon the road—driving straight in. The Book of Odes even mentions a siege chariot called <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="臨.html">臨</a><span class="kanji-inline">衝</span>, fitted with iron at the tip of its long poles to smash fortress gates. From these images, <span class="kanji-inline">衝</span> comes to mean a head-on blow or impact, and by extension a main thoroughfare or direct line of advance.</p>
