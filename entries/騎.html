    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="馬.html">馬</a> supplies the sense of the horse and, by extension, the act of mounting or sitting astride, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奇.html">奇</a> gives the on-yomi ki and carries the nuance of “single.” In contrast to war chariots that could be driven three-abreast by adding side horses to a central team, <span class="kanji-inline">騎</span> denotes riding a single horse—horseback riding—as in kiba. Thus the graph came to signify a mounted rider and, by extension, cavalry, a form of warfare that rose to prominence from the Spring and Autumn through the Warring States period.</p>
