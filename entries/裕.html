    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">裕</span> is a phono-semantic character. Its phonetic is the element <span class="kanji-inline">谷</span>, not the “valley” reading but the sign seen in <span class="kanji-inline">容</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">欲</span>, where it depicts the dim appearance of divine pneuma rising above a sai— the covenant vessel that holds prayers. In bronze inscriptions for <span class="kanji-inline">裕</span>, this <span class="kanji-inline">谷</span> sign is written within <span class="kanji-inline">衣</span>, “garment,” so the whole graph shows numinous abundance manifesting upon clothing. From that image come the senses of plenitude and of garments that hang loose, reflected in modern compounds such as yufuku and fuyu denoting material wealth.</p>
