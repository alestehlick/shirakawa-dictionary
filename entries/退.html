    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">退</span> as a compound whose older, proper form is written like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="復.html">復</a>, combining three elements: <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, the step sign from the left half of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a> that suggests a short movement; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皿.html">皿</a>, the ritual dish piled with offerings; and <span class="kanji-inline">夊</span>, a foot turned backward. In Shang–Zhou inscriptions this depicts returning the heaped offering vessels to their place after the rite has concluded, and from that scene arise meanings such as to draw back, to retreat, and to put something back or pull it down. In divinatory usage, the omen-bird <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span> figures in deciding whether to continue or desist: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遂.html">遂</a> names the outcome of proceeding, while <span class="kanji-inline">退</span> names the outcome of withdrawing. Over time those earlier graphs fell out of use, and <span class="kanji-inline">退</span> became the standard character for retreat and withdrawal.</p>
