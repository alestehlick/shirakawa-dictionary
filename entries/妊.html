    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">妊</span> as a phono-semantic compound: the woman radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a> provides the field of meaning, while <span class="kanji-inline">壬</span> functions as the phonetic. <span class="kanji-inline">壬</span> originally depicts a forging stand with a thick, bulging center; that swelling profile is carried over to evoke the rounding of a woman’s abdomen, giving <span class="kanji-inline">妊</span> the sense “to conceive, to be pregnant.” In contrast, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="娠.html">娠</a> conveys the child’s movement within, likened to the stirring of a clam, and together the compound <span class="kanji-inline">妊</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="娠.html">娠</a> names the state of pregnancy. This accords with the Shuowen gloss “to become pregnant.” Related pictographs that express the same idea include <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="身.html">身</a>, showing a side view of a person with a distended belly, and <span class="kanji-inline">孕</span>, which writes an embryo set within the belly of a standing figure.</p>
