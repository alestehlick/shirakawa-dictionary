    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奴.html">奴</a> supplies the sound do, while <span class="kanji-inline">力</span>—seen here as the form of a plow—points to agricultural labor. From its graphic makeup, the character evokes a servant working diligently in the fields. In an age without machines, cultivating the soil and producing one’s livelihood demanded doryoku: unremitting, assiduous effort. The related graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="怒.html">怒</a> expresses fierce emotion; that same intensity was felt necessary for earnest striving. In time, the sense broadened beyond farming to mean simply to strive and make an effort.</p>
