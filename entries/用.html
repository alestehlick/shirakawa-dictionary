    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph of a fence or enclosure made by fitting wooden pieces together. Within such an enclosed space, offerings for ritual worship were placed and elevated; hence <span class="kanji-inline">用</span> originally meant to employ something for a sacrificial purpose. A passage in the Spring and Autumn Annals uses <span class="kanji-inline">用</span> in this sense of offering—blood being taken and used for the rite—showing the word’s early ritual coloring. From that core it broadened to the general meanings “to use, employ,” and also came to function, like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="以.html">以</a>, with the sense “by means of, with.”</p>
