    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">禮</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">礼</span> is a phono-semantic character: the ritual element marks the sphere of ceremony, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="豊.html">豊</a> serves as the phonetic, yielding the on reading rei. The same phonetic appears in <span class="kanji-inline">醴</span>, glossed in the Shuowen as a sweet rice wine matured overnight, a drink often used in formal rites (<span class="kanji-inline">醴</span><span class="kanji-inline">酒</span>). The graph thus evokes conducting a ceremony with sweet ritual wine and, by extension, comes to mean proper ritual, etiquette, and respectful bearing. The Zhong Yong famously speaks of “three hundred rules of ceremony and three thousand of dignified deportment,” reflecting the deep cultural emphasis on <span class="kanji-inline">礼</span>; from that concern arose the elaborate formalism later known as <span class="kanji-inline">繁</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="文.html">文</a><span class="kanji-inline">縟</span><span class="kanji-inline">礼</span>. The simplified form <span class="kanji-inline">礼</span> used today for <span class="kanji-inline">禮</span> is already recorded in the Shuowen as an ancient variant and is attested on Han stone inscriptions.</p>
