    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character: it portrays action with the legs and takes <span class="kanji-inline">甬</span> as its sound element, giving the on-yomi yo. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">甬</span> originally depicted a wooden bucket, and in words like <span class="kanji-inline">涌</span> it conveys the idea of something welling up. As the Shuowen glosses it, the sense is “to jump, to spring up,” so <span class="kanji-inline">踊</span> came to denote leaping with the legs and, by extension, dancing. In Japanese it is read odoru and odori for dance, and a variant form is written <span class="kanji-inline">踴</span>.</p>
