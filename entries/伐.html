    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">伐</span> combines the person element with the halberd <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>, picturing the act of striking down and cutting off a person’s head. From this vivid image arise the senses of striking, cutting, and beheading. Oracle-bone inscriptions record queries such as “<span class="kanji-inline">伐</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="三.html">三</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="十.html">十</a><span class="kanji-inline">羌</span>,” asking whether a set number of Qiang people should be killed, and Shang royal tombs contain many separately buried heads in groups of ten, likely Qiang victims offered as sacrificial offerings. Rooted in this martial and sacrificial context, <span class="kanji-inline">伐</span> came to signify punitive attack and subjugation. The compound <span class="kanji-inline">伐</span><span class="kanji-inline">旌</span> referred to the bestowal of military honors and fostered later uses meaning to display one’s merits and to boast of them.</p>
