    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the earliest scripts on tortoise plastron and bone, as well as in bronze inscriptions, this character is formed by taking the figure of a person (<span class="kanji-inline">人</span>) and adding a short stroke to the leg, a deliberate notch that distinguishes it from the ordinary <span class="kanji-inline">人</span> and assigns it a numeric value. With this marked “person,” the texts denote the number thousand; and to show two thousand or three thousand, they add the numerals <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="二.html">二</a> or <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="三.html">三</a> to that leg portion. The character thus arose as a specially notched human figure used as the sign for a thousand.</p>
