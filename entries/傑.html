    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">傑</span> is a phono-semantic character built from the person sign <span class="kanji-inline">亻</span> and the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">桀</span>. In ancient forms <span class="kanji-inline">桀</span> depicts criminals stretched out and fastened to the right and left branches of a tree—a scene that underlies the graph <span class="kanji-inline">磔</span>, “crucifixion.” Related images help fix the picture: <span class="kanji-inline">梟</span> shows an inverted head with hair hanging down, the act of suspending it (kakeru), and when that head is shown hung from a branch by a cord it becomes <span class="kanji-inline">縣</span> (later <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="県.html">県</a>). From such violent, awe-charged rites, the spirit of the executed was thought to be intensely potent. With <span class="kanji-inline">亻</span> indicating “person” and <span class="kanji-inline">桀</span> supplying both sound and the notion of fierce, surpassing vigor, <span class="kanji-inline">傑</span> came to mean an outstanding person, one who excels and outdoes others.</p>
