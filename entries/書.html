    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">書</span> is a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span>, the hand holding a writing brush, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a>, which in its archaic form shows branches piled over a ritual “sai” receptacle and then covered with earth to make an earthen hedge—the source of <span class="kanji-inline">堵</span>, “clay wall.” In early villages such walls were embedded with talismanic slips as protective charms, and <span class="kanji-inline">書</span> originally named the sacred characters brushed onto these talismans. From this ritual center it came to mean an official document; bronze inscriptions preserve formulas like “receive the writing and confer investiture.” Because of this sacred-administrative role, <span class="kanji-inline">書</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="史.html">史</a> referred to the official in charge of documents; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="史.html">史</a> itself first denoted a rite and its record. Over time the sense broadened to ordinary writing—letters, books, and characters—and to calligraphy executed according to established methods (<span class="kanji-inline">書</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="法.html">法</a>), a celebrated art of the East.</p>
