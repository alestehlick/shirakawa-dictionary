    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">福</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a>, the sign of the ritual altar, with a phonetic element depicting a vessel swollen like a brimming wine barrel (<span class="kanji-inline">畐</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">冨</span>), which also supplies the sound fuku. The character thus evokes setting a full wine vessel before the gods to petition for happiness. Bronze inscriptions even show a form with a roof-like element above this vessel, pointing to the ancestral mausoleum where such offerings were made, and where good fortune was believed to be granted in response. By extension, <span class="kanji-inline">福</span> can refer to sacrificial fare and offerings—himorogi, such as meat or rice—set out for the deities. The phrase <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="致.html">致</a><span class="kanji-inline">福</span> describes the custom of dividing these offerings among one’s kin or clan: sharing what has been offered signifies receiving the gods’ favor and bounty, the <span class="kanji-inline">福</span><span class="kanji-inline">禄</span> bestowed through the rite.</p>
