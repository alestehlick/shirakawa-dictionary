    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of the sun: a round disk marked with a central dot to show it is not an empty circle but a body with substance. Because the sun, unlike the moon, has no phases, the figure is drawn as a consistent circle. From this image the character came to mean day, the sun itself, and light. The Sino-Japanese reading jitsu is sometimes explained by association with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="実.html">実</a>, “fullness,” evoking the sun that fills and enriches. In Japanese it also appears as ka in dates, as in yokka, “the fourth day.”</p>
