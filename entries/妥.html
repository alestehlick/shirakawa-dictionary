    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its original form <span class="kanji-inline">妥</span> combines a hand (<span class="kanji-inline">爪</span>) placed above a woman (<span class="kanji-inline">女</span>), picturing a hand soothing someone, and by extension “to make peaceful.” Classical glosses describe it as “to sit calmly,” and it even served as the original graph for <span class="kanji-inline">綏</span> in phrases like <span class="kanji-inline">綏</span><span class="kanji-inline">安</span>, “to pacify.” In compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">妥</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="協.html">協</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">妥</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="結.html">結</a> it conveys bringing matters into a settled, moderate state through accommodation, which is why <span class="kanji-inline">妥</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="当.html">当</a> expresses what is apt or proper. The character thus centers on calmness and gentle moderation—making things peaceful and appropriately settled.</p>
