    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character built from the food radical on the left and the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="官.html">官</a> on the right. Shirakawa explains <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="官.html">官</a> as the figure of a sacred quarters where the “worship meat” for the army’s shrine was kept—meat offerings that were carried when the army set out and enshrined in a building when it encamped. Thus <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="官.html">官</a> originally indicated a consecrated building and, by extension, the residence of commanding generals. With the addition of the food element, <span class="kanji-inline">館</span> drew on that idea of an official, housed place to denote the generals’ lodge and, more broadly, halls and mansions used for public ceremonies. The meaning later widened to institutional buildings—governmental and diplomatic offices, schools—and in modern usage appears in names such as ryokan (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="旅.html">旅</a><span class="kanji-inline">館</span>, an inn) and eigakan (<span class="kanji-inline">映</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="画.html">画</a><span class="kanji-inline">館</span>, a cinema).</p>
