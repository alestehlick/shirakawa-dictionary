    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="工.html">工</a>, the craftsman’s tool, and <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>, the act of striking, this character originally evoked applying a tool by striking—doing handiwork, making utensils, and by extension mastering a craft. The Zhou Rites’ Kao Gong Ji records such uses in occupational names like <span class="kanji-inline">攻</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> for woodworkers and <span class="kanji-inline">攻</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="金.html">金</a> for metalworkers, designating those engaged in manufacturing wood and metal goods. The graph was also adopted in military contexts, as in <span class="kanji-inline">戎</span><span class="kanji-inline">攻</span> for preparations and operations of war, from which its later and now primary sense, to attack and open hostilities, arose.</p>
