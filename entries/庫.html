    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound formed from the shelter radical <span class="kanji-inline">广</span>, which depicts a building set against a cliff, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="車.html">車</a>, the war chariot. It originally named the building where chariots were gathered and housed, and by extension came to mean any kura—storehouse for collected goods. Because chariots were drawn by two horses, such places naturally included both sheds for the vehicles and nearby stables. The idea appears in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="府.html">府</a><span class="kanji-inline">庫</span>, repositories for important writings and goods, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="武.html">武</a><span class="kanji-inline">庫</span>, a “martial storehouse,” used figuratively of outstanding prowess in arms. Storing a war chariot was accompanied by purification and exorcism using sacrificial blood, so these storehouses were often attached to sacred precincts.</p>
