    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">盆</span> is a phono-semantic character: the dish component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皿.html">皿</a> indicates a vessel, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="分.html">分</a> serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading bon. The Shuowen glosses it as a hachi, or bowl, and distinguishes it from <span class="kanji-inline">盎</span>: <span class="kanji-inline">盎</span> has a swollen belly and narrow mouth, whereas <span class="kanji-inline">盆</span> describes a vessel with a narrow base and wide mouth. In accounts from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods (Lie Guo), bronze vessels called <span class="kanji-inline">盆</span> are mentioned, shaped much like a water basin (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鑑.html">鑑</a>). In later usage it came to denote a flat serving tray for tableware. In Japan, urabon—the mid-seventh-month Buddhist observance for the dead—is commonly shortened to bon or obon.</p>
