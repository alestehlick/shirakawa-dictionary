    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, <span class="kanji-inline">隆</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span>, the earthen mound, with a sign of a foot pointing downward (<span class="kanji-inline">夂</span>) set before the shrine altar (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a>). The vertical element evokes the gods’ ladder by which deities ascend and descend; <span class="kanji-inline">夂</span> shows the act of coming down, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a> identifies the shrine where the descent is received. Altogether it depicts the divine spirit descending to the shrine along the gods’ ladder, and from this image the character came to express the flourishing, abundant, elevated might conferred by the gods—later generalized to meanings such as prosperous, abundant, high, and great.</p>
