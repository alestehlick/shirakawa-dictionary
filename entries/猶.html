    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character built on <span class="kanji-inline">酋</span> as the phonetic, which signals the on-reading yuu and originally referred to ritual liquor offered to the gods. The earliest form of the graph is written <span class="kanji-inline">猶</span>, but in bronze inscriptions it often appears as <span class="kanji-inline">猷</span>, depicting a dog offered together with libations—an image of worship and divination to seek the gods’ will. Hence in the Zong Zhou Zhong inscription we find <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="朕.html">朕</a><span class="kanji-inline">猷</span>, “my plan,” where the word denotes a plan or stratagem derived from divine consultation. Over time the two graphs were interchanged and then differentiated: <span class="kanji-inline">猷</span> came to be used specifically for ‘plan/stratagem,’ while <span class="kanji-inline">猶</span>, in association with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="由.html">由</a>, developed adverbial senses such as ‘still, yet, moreover,’ and, through association with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="誘.html">誘</a>, it could also shade into meanings like ‘to entice or delude.’</p>
