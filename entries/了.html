    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa understands <span class="kanji-inline">了</span> as a pictograph of something being twisted or wound. The Shuowen already glosses it as “entangled,” and the graph evokes the shape of intertwined strands. From the way a tangled or knotted thread brings movement to a halt, the character naturally came to mean “to finish, to come to an end.” In graphic and semantic affinity with forms such as <span class="kanji-inline">繚</span> (to wrap, to wind) and with <span class="kanji-inline">瞭</span> (clear), it also extends to intellectual clarity—hence uses meaning “to comprehend, to understand,” and “clear.”</p>
