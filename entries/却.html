    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">却</span> is a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="去.html">去</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">卩</span>. <span class="kanji-inline">卩</span> depicts a kneeling, bowing person. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="去.html">去</a>, in Shirakawa’s reading, originally means “to throw away”: in ancient ordeal-style trials conducted under the gods, the convicted loser (shown by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>) was cast off together with a ritual covenant vessel whose lid had been removed, because the prayers were found false. This same idea appears in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="法.html">法</a>, which shows the loser being thrown into water. Placing <span class="kanji-inline">卩</span> beside <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="去.html">去</a> gives the image of a person bowing before what is being cast off or driven away. From this scene comes the sense of <span class="kanji-inline">却</span>: to reject, drive away, cut off, avoid, or refuse, and by extension to retreat.</p>
