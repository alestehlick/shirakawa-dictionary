    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">狩</span> as a later phono-semantic creation: the left side <span class="kanji-inline">犭</span> evokes the hunting dog, while the right side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="守.html">守</a> supplies the sound shu. Earlier, the act of hunting was written with <span class="kanji-inline">獸</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="獣.html">獣</a>). Its ancient form combined an upper <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="単.html">単</a>, depicting an oval shield adorned with twin feather plumes used in the hunt, and a lower ritual receptacle for covenant-prayers to the gods, evoking the formal petition for success before setting out; with the addition of the dog element, this yielded <span class="kanji-inline">獸</span>, originally “the hunt” itself. As usage shifted and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="獣.html">獣</a> came to mean the quarry—the animal taken—<span class="kanji-inline">狩</span> was coined specifically for the act “to hunt.” In compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="巡.html">巡</a><span class="kanji-inline">狩</span>, it preserves an elevated nuance of the sovereign’s circuit to inspect and safeguard the realm, echoing the sense of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="巡.html">巡</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="守.html">守</a>, “to go around and protect.”</p>
