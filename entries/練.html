    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character whose oldest form was written <span class="kanji-inline">鍊</span>, with <span class="kanji-inline">柬</span> serving as the phonetic element. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">柬</span> depicts a sack with something inside it, evoking a receptacle used in making or processing goods, and thus suggests manufacture. The Shuowen glosses the word as “to regulate metal,” that is, to heat it and cleanse away impurities—tempering and refining. Related graphs distinguish the methods: <span class="kanji-inline">涑</span> denotes refining by water, while <span class="kanji-inline">煉</span> denotes refining by fire. From this image of purification and working material to perfection, the character came to express the training and polishing of body, mind, and technique, as in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">練</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="磨.html">磨</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鍛.html">鍛</a><span class="kanji-inline">練</span>.</p>
