    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="音.html">音</a> conveys the idea of sound, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="員.html">員</a> serves as the phonetic and also lends a nuance of something mellow and graceful. In earlier usage, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="均.html">均</a> was at times employed as the phonetic, and in Japan a streamlined form akin to today’s <span class="kanji-inline">韵</span> appeared; this was further abbreviated to <span class="kanji-inline">勻</span>, from which the kokuji <span class="kanji-inline">匂</span> (“to smell”) later developed. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">韻</span> names not only the resonance or tonal quality of sound, but by extension any tasteful presence endowed with charm, as in the expression <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="風.html">風</a><span class="kanji-inline">韻</span>, “elegant style.”</p>
