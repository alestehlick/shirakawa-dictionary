    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">體</span>, the character combines the bone element with <span class="kanji-inline">豊</span> as a phonetic, making it a phono-semantic compound. <span class="kanji-inline">豊</span> serves as the on-reading indicator, and within the old phonological correspondences an initial l-series manifests as a t-series in Sino-Japanese, which explains the readings tai/tei (a pattern also seen in words like <span class="kanji-inline">頼</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">留</span>). In the Zhou Rites, Inner Cooking section, <span class="kanji-inline">體</span> refers to the sacrificial body whose limbs and flesh are distinguished and prepared; from this ritual sense of the offering’s body, the meaning broadened to the human body and, more generally, to one’s outward form or shape.</p>
