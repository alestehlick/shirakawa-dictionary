    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with <span class="kanji-inline">衣</span>, “garment,” indicating clothing, and <span class="kanji-inline">中</span>, “inside,” which also supplies the on reading chuu. In the Shuowen it names the innerwear worn next to the skin, and the Zuo Zhuan speaks of <span class="kanji-inline">衷</span><span class="kanji-inline">甲</span>, armor worn beneath one’s outer clothes. From this concrete image of what is hidden under a garment, the character came to express the inner mind and true sincerity that do not show outwardly, as in <span class="kanji-inline">衷</span><span class="kanji-inline">心</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">衷</span><span class="kanji-inline">情</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">衷</span><span class="kanji-inline">誠</span>. By the same sense of “the inside” or “the middle,” <span class="kanji-inline">衷</span> can also substitute for <span class="kanji-inline">中</span> in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">折</span><span class="kanji-inline">衷</span>, the balanced reconciliation that selects the best from both sides.</p>
