    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A picto-phonetic graph, <span class="kanji-inline">墓</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> “earth” with <span class="kanji-inline">莫</span> as the phonetic element marking the sound bo and suggesting the dusk-like gloom appropriate to burial. Yin-period emblems even depict <span class="kanji-inline">莫</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">犬</span> “dog” set within a large <span class="kanji-inline">亞</span>, a plan view of an underground grave—the dog indicating the purificatory sacrifice offered to ward off defilement. Graves were not placed in low, damp ground but on dry hills; in early times they were cut deep into the earth, and later the earth was heaped up to form a visible mound.</p>
