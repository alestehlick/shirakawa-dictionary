    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">右</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>, the sign of the right hand, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>, here not a mouth but the sacred sai receptacle that held written petitions to the gods. The character shows one holding this covenant vessel in the right hand and praying—seeking the gods’ place and asking for their assistance—whence the sense of “to help,” preserved in derivatives such as <span class="kanji-inline">佑</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">祐</span>. Its counterpart <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="左.html">左</a> depicts the left hand with a ritual implement, and <span class="kanji-inline">尋</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="左.html">左</a> over <span class="kanji-inline">右</span> to convey “to inquire” after the deities’ whereabouts. From this ritual scene the graph later came to denote the right side, and by extension “to value, to honor,” as in the expression <span class="kanji-inline">右</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="文.html">文</a>.</p>
