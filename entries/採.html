    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character built on <span class="kanji-inline">采</span> as its phonetic core, giving the on-reading sai. The ancient form of <span class="kanji-inline">采</span> depicts a hand or fingertips poised above a tree, reaching up to pluck its fruit. When the hand classifier (<span class="kanji-inline">扌</span>) was added to this form, it focused the meaning into the concrete action of taking or picking—thus <span class="kanji-inline">採</span>. In later usage <span class="kanji-inline">采</span> itself came to suggest “coloring,” the hues obtained from plants and trees, while <span class="kanji-inline">採</span> remained the verb for taking, choosing, or gathering.</p>
