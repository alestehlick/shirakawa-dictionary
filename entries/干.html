    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest forms, this character is a straightforward pictograph of a rectangular shield. Related graphs help clarify the scene: <span class="kanji-inline">盾</span> depicts a person raising a shield before the eyes to protect the body, while <span class="kanji-inline">單</span> (used within <span class="kanji-inline">戰</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">戦</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">獸</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="獣.html">獣</a>) shows a round shield adorned with feathers, evoking warfare and hunting. <span class="kanji-inline">干</span> is the plain, rectangular shield itself. Shirakawa further notes that <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="周.html">周</a> adds beneath this shield the sign of a covenant vessel into which petitions to the gods were placed, expressing prayers for victory. From this origin, <span class="kanji-inline">干</span> first meant “shield,” and by extension “to fend off” or “to protect,” a sense visible in derivatives such as <span class="kanji-inline">扞</span>, where the hand radical joins the shield to mean “to ward off.” The graph also came to be used for “to encroach, violate” and “to disturb,” and, through phonetic association with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="乾.html">乾</a> (kan), it was borrowed to write “to dry” (hosu, hiru).</p>
