    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">委</span> as a ritual image: the graph combines <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span>, a rice spray worn as a headdress and emblem of the rice spirit, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a>, a woman. It portrays a woman dancing with the rice plant on her head during the rice‑planting ceremonies that sought a rich harvest; a paired male dance is reflected in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="年.html">年</a>, which in antiquity showed a person beneath a rice plant. Because the woman’s dance is low and supple, the character came to suggest low, compliant, and yielding attitudes, hence the sense of entrusting or leaving a matter to another. From this notion of pliancy arose nuances like feeble or worn thin, and related graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">萎</span> (wither) and <span class="kanji-inline">痿</span> (numb, weakened) carry this thread of withering and loss of vigor.</p>
