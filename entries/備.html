    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: its phonetic element is <span class="kanji-inline">葡</span>, which Shirakawa reads as the form of an ebira, the box-shaped quiver worn on the back. In early oracle-bone forms the quiver is shown packed with arrows. With the person radical added, the whole graph depicts someone carrying a quiver on their back—an image of being ready for combat. From this concrete scene the meaning broadened to preparing for something, providing what is needed, and being furnished with equipment. Because true preparedness implies having everything in place, the character also came to express doing something fully and in detail, even the sense of “all.”</p>
