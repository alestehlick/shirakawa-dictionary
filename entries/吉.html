    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">吉</span> is a compound graph that sets a sacred broadax above a covenant receptacle. The upper element depicts the downward-pointing blade of a small broadax, an instrument thought to drive away evil, while the lower element is the box into which written prayers to the gods were placed. By placing the broadax over the prayer box, the character shows sealing and preserving the efficacy of those petitions. When the state of the prayer under this protective sign becomes “good,” wishes are fulfilled and people rejoice, hence the senses of good, fortunate, and auspicious. A related graph, <span class="kanji-inline">吾</span>, similarly pictures protecting the prayers by covering the receptacle with a double wooden lid.</p>
