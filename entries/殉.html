    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">殉</span> is a phono-semantic compound. On the left, <span class="kanji-inline">歹</span> shows the upper part of a skeleton—the remains of a corpse—while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="死.html">死</a>, in its original form, depicts a person paying reverence to those remains. On the right, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="旬.html">旬</a> supplies the sound jun and also evokes the sense of moving in sequence or following, which here is extended to the act of following a person into death. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">殉</span> came to mean to die for or with one’s lord, as in <span class="kanji-inline">殉</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="死.html">死</a> (the retainer’s suicide after a ruler’s death), and <span class="kanji-inline">殉</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="葬.html">葬</a> (interment as an attendant in the same burial). In the tombs of the Shang kings, young people were sometimes buried as such companions, likely to impart vitality to the deceased ruler; in later times, clay figures were used in their stead.</p>
