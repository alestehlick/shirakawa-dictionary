    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph showing assorted grains—both glutinous broomcorn millet and non‑glutinous millet—piled high on a tall-footed ritual vessel (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="豆.html">豆</a>). Such heaped offerings were presented in worship, and the image of a vessel brimming with grain naturally conveyed “plenty,” giving the senses of abundance and richness; from this it also came to be used for “large” and “flourishing.” The same graph serves as the right-hand element in <span class="kanji-inline">醴</span> (rei/li), the sweet rice liquor known as amazake, where it contributes the nuance of rich, ample sweetness.</p>
