    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="麻.html">麻</a> serving as the phonetic, signaling the On reading ma and evoking motions done with forceful, fingertip pressure. Classical sources gloss it as “to polish,” and by extension “to wear away,” the sense seen in compounds like mametsu (to be worn out and vanish). Because <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="麻.html">麻</a> marks the same dynamic hand action, <span class="kanji-inline">磨</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="摩.html">摩</a> often substitute for one another in usage, as in magai (cliff-side carvings) and masatsu (rubbing, friction). Traditional lexica also record a related stone-radical form, <span class="kanji-inline">礦</span>, under the same phonetic line. Altogether, <span class="kanji-inline">磨</span> centers on the actions of polishing, rubbing, and grinding that gradually abrade a surface.</p>
