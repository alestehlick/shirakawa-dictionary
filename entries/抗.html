    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">抗</span> is a phono-semantic compound: the hand (<span class="kanji-inline">扌</span>) joins <span class="kanji-inline">亢</span> as the phonetic. Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">亢</span> as the figure of a human throat with the arteries standing out, a sign of heightened excitement or indignation—hence the fervent feeling in words like <span class="kanji-inline">慷</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="慨.html">慨</a>. Set beside the hand, it evokes meeting something head-on and pushing back, which gives the senses of resisting, refusing, warding off, or striking against. Many graphs built on <span class="kanji-inline">亢</span> and read kō—such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="坑.html">坑</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">炕</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">杭</span>—likewise carry a direct, forceful tone.</p>
