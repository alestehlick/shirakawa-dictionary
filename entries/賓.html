    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">賓</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span>, the roof of an ancestral mausoleum, with <span class="kanji-inline">万</span>, the hind leg of an animal prepared for sacrifice, and <span class="kanji-inline">貝</span>, a shell used as a ritual implement. The graph pictures bringing a sacrificial hind leg together with a shell into the mausoleum as part of a rite to invite and welcome the gods. From this ceremony of receiving a visiting deity—a guest god from elsewhere—the meaning broadened to human guests and to the act of treating and entertaining them. The same reading hin appears in <span class="kanji-inline">殯</span>, “lying in state,” which likewise belongs to the sphere of ancestral and funerary rites.</p>
