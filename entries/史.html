    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">史</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="中.html">中</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>, with early forms showing two complementary lineages. One depicts a military flagstaff with cloth streamers fluttering above and below—the banner of the central army—while the other shows a covenant vessel for prayer slips fixed to a wooden pole. The element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a> is the right hand; together they depict a person raising, in the right hand, a pole to which the sacred receptacle is attached, invoking and worshipping the gods. In the Yin period this gesture named the inner rites of ancestral worship at the royal mausoleum. When such rites were performed in the provinces at mountains and rivers, a royal envoy <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="使.html">使</a> carried a larger branch-pole fitted with the covenant vessel and a tubular streamer; this outward rite is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="事.html">事</a>, later associated with service. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">史</span> originally meant the act and office of worship, and subsequently came to denote the ritual official who conducted and recorded these ceremonies—the sense that leads to “history” and “historian.”</p>
