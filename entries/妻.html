    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph of a woman arranging an elaborate bridal coiffure: both hands are raised to the head, setting three ornamental hairpins into place. It captures the moment of being dressed for a wedding, which naturally yields the sense “wife,” and by extension was also used as a verb meaning to match or marry. Its counterpart <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夫.html">夫</a> depicts a man seen from the front (the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a> form) with a long hairpin thrust vertically through his topknot, likewise showing ceremonial finery. Together, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夫.html">夫</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">妻</span> present the groom and bride adorned for marriage.</p>
