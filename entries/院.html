    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph, <span class="kanji-inline">院</span> takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="完.html">完</a> as its phonetic element, signaling the on reading, and early materials even wrote the word with <span class="kanji-inline">寃</span>. Its core sense lies in <span class="kanji-inline">垣</span>—an enclosing fence or hedge—so <span class="kanji-inline">院</span> depicts a building set within a fenced perimeter, and by extension the grounds or garden belonging to it. From this image of an enclosed residence grew specialized uses such as <span class="kanji-inline">書</span><span class="kanji-inline">院</span>, the scholar’s study or house, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="僧.html">僧</a><span class="kanji-inline">院</span>, a monks’ dwelling, which in turn gave rise to the broader modern sense of an organized institution.</p>
