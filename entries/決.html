    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">決</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water radical <span class="kanji-inline">氵</span> joins the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">夬</span>. In early forms, <span class="kanji-inline">夬</span> shows a hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>) grasping a notched jade ring, <span class="kanji-inline">玦</span> (jue), a pendant worn at the waist that served as a small cutter; that cutting force in <span class="kanji-inline">夬</span> appears as well in graphs like <span class="kanji-inline">抉</span>, “to gouge.” With water added, <span class="kanji-inline">決</span> depicts cutting through so that stagnant water can run off—opening a breach in a dike to release a flood. Because cutting a levee is a momentous act undertaken with firm resolve (one even raised the jade jue as a sign of determination), the character naturally extends from “to cut and let flow” to “to decide,” a clear, resolute settling of the heart.</p>
