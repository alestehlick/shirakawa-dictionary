    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">摘</span> as a phono-semantic compound: the hand radical on the left signals a manual action, while the right-side phonetic from the <span class="kanji-inline">商</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">啇</span> series gives the on-yomi teki. He explains <span class="kanji-inline">商</span> as a graph combining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="帝.html">帝</a>, the supreme deity, with a vessel-like element that represents a sacred receptacle for written prayers, thus denoting a person of rank permitted to worship the high god; this graph also stands as the ancestor of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="嫡.html">嫡</a>. For the sense, he invokes <span class="kanji-inline">蔕</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">蒂</span>, the spot on a blossom that becomes fruit or seed: <span class="kanji-inline">摘</span> depicts plucking that very point with the hand. Hence the ancient gloss “to take fruit from a fruit tree,” later broadening to “pick, pluck, take,” “pick out, select,” and, in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">指</span><span class="kanji-inline">摘</span>, “to point out, indicate.”</p>
