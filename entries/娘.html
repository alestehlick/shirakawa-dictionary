    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a picto-phonetic graph formed with the woman element and a phonetic. In its older form <span class="kanji-inline">孃</span>, the phonetic was <span class="kanji-inline">襄</span>, which also means to swell or grow full, conjuring the image of a well-shaped, full-bosomed woman. From that image the character came to denote a woman in her prime and, by extension, the roles of mother and daughter. The later graph <span class="kanji-inline">娘</span>, using <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="良.html">良</a> as its phonetic, came into common use from the Sui and Tang periods. The cultural life of the word is vivid: Sui records speak of the <span class="kanji-inline">娘</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="軍.html">軍</a>, a “women’s army,” and in China the <span class="kanji-inline">娘</span><span class="kanji-inline">娘</span><span class="kanji-inline">廟</span>—temples to the Niángniáng goddess who grants children—drew lively popular devotion. These usages underscore the character’s enduring association with womanhood and childbirth.</p>
