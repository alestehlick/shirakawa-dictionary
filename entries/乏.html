    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a body lying on its back—a supine corpse. In the same graphic family, <span class="kanji-inline">泛</span> depicts a corpse floating face up on water, <span class="kanji-inline">氾</span> shows one floating face down, and <span class="kanji-inline">窆</span> portrays the act of lowering the dead into a grave pit. From this stark image of depletion, the character took on the sense of want and insufficiency. Hence its use in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">匱</span><span class="kanji-inline">乏</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">欠</span><span class="kanji-inline">乏</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="耐.html">耐</a><span class="kanji-inline">乏</span>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貧.html">貧</a><span class="kanji-inline">乏</span> to express shortage, lack, enduring scarcity, and poverty—everything marked by meagerness or being in short supply.</p>
