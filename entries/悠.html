    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">悠</span> is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">攸</span> as its phonetic. In ancient form, <span class="kanji-inline">攸</span> shows water being poured to wash a person’s back—a scene of ritual purification—so it carries the sense of cleansing. With the heart/mind element, the character comes to express the condition after such ablutions: a spirit calmed, loosened, and unhurried. From this it naturally yields meanings like gentle, tranquil, and leisurely, and by extension the ideas of distance and long duration, as in <span class="kanji-inline">悠</span><span class="kanji-inline">遠</span> (remote) and <span class="kanji-inline">悠</span><span class="kanji-inline">久</span> (enduring). A further nuance of sustained contemplation, seen in expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">悠</span><span class="kanji-inline">思</span>, also fostered associations with grieving; the Shuowen even glosses it with <span class="kanji-inline">憂</span>, “to grieve.”</p>
