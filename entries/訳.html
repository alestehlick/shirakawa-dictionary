    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">譯</span>, this is a phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> “speech” providing the meaning and <span class="kanji-inline">睪</span> as the phonetic. Shirakawa notes that <span class="kanji-inline">睪</span> depicts the body of a dead animal, and he connects this to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="釈.html">釈</a>, the idea of “unravelling” what has been scattered—an image that suits translation: taking utterance apart, analyzing it piece by piece, and re-expressing it in another language. The Shuowen already defines it as the person who conveys and translates the words of the peoples of the four quarters, and early sources record official interpreters—<span class="kanji-inline">舌</span><span class="kanji-inline">人</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">象</span><span class="kanji-inline">胥</span>—charged with this task. In Japanese, the native reading wake appears in expressions such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>い<span class="kanji-inline">訳</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="内.html">内</a><span class="kanji-inline">訳</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">訳</span>が<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="違.html">違</a>う, preserving the nuance of sorting out, explaining, and giving the reason.</p>
