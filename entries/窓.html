    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Early forms such as <span class="kanji-inline">窗</span> and related shapes are straightforward pictographs of a window. The modern Japanese form <span class="kanji-inline">窓</span> is a simplified development from <span class="kanji-inline">窗</span>, while the variant <span class="kanji-inline">囪</span> serves as a phonetic that points to the on-yomi sō. The Shuowen notes that when the opening is set in a wall (<span class="kanji-inline">牆</span>) it is called <span class="kanji-inline">牖</span>—an aperture or light-opening—and when within a room it is a window, evoking a framed opening to the sky, like a skylight. In practice, <span class="kanji-inline">窓</span> is used simply for “window.” The added <span class="kanji-inline">心</span> component may have been intended to suggest clarity or keen insight (as in <span class="kanji-inline">聡</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="明.html">明</a>), though the character itself is not used with that sense.</p>
