    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">悦</span> as a phono‑semantic compound with <span class="kanji-inline">兌</span> supplying the on‑reading etsu and picturing a ritual shaman (the figure <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="兄.html">兄</a>) who carries on the head a covenant vessel into which petitions to the gods are placed, while the sign <span class="kanji-inline">八</span> suggests the gentle descent of divine breath upon that servant. With the heart element added, the character points to the shaman’s heart seized and suffused with rapture in response to the deity’s presence. From this image comes the sense of being gladdened and taking delight; relatedly, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="説.html">説</a> was also used in the sense “to rejoice.”</p>
