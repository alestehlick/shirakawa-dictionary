    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">欲</span> is a phono-semantic character built on a specific form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="谷.html">谷</a> used as a phonetic to signal the on-reading yoku (also seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="俗.html">俗</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="容.html">容</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="浴.html">浴</a>), distinct from the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="谷.html">谷</a> read koku meaning “valley.” In the related graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="容.html">容</a>, the writing depicts a sacred “sai” vessel into which petitions to the gods are placed within an ancestral mausoleum, with a faint manifestation of numinous breath appearing above it. <span class="kanji-inline">欲</span> expresses the yearning to behold that numinous form, and from this sense of longing it came to mean “to desire, to wish.” The same phonetic element appears in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="浴.html">浴</a> (yoku, “to bathe”). In Japanese usage, <span class="kanji-inline">欲</span> also serves in the adjective hoshii, “to want.”</p>
