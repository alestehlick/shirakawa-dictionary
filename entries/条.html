    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">條</span>, this character combines <span class="kanji-inline">攸</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>. <span class="kanji-inline">攸</span> is formed from a person, a drop of water, and <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>, depicting water being poured over someone’s back to wash and purify it—a scene of ritual ablution. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> here is a bundle of leafy twigs used in that rite. From this setting the word first meant a long branch, then broadened to the idea of something that stretches out in a line—hence senses such as to extend and, figuratively, the thread or coherence of reasoning. From the notion of lines arranged in order it further developed the administrative and legal meanings of an article or clause, as in numbered paragraphs of a document.</p>
