    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">統</span> as a phono-semantic graph: the left side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a> “thread” provides the domain of meaning, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="充.html">充</a> serves as the phonetic. He notes that <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="充.html">充</a> depicts a person seen from the side with a distended belly, and in Shuowen it is explained through the idea of a <span class="kanji-inline">紀</span>, a spool or skein—the place where many threads collect. From this image of drawing numerous strands onto a single core, the character came to mean gathering things into one order: to bring together, to unify, and by extension to rule and control. That sense lives on in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">統</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="一.html">一</a> (unification), <span class="kanji-inline">統</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="制.html">制</a> (control), <span class="kanji-inline">統</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="理.html">理</a> (governance), <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="系.html">系</a><span class="kanji-inline">統</span> (an ordered system), and <span class="kanji-inline">統</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="括.html">括</a>・<span class="kanji-inline">統</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="轄.html">轄</a> (to oversee as a whole).</p>
