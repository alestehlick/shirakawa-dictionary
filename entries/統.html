    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">統</span> as a phono-semantic graph: the left side <span class="kanji-inline">糸</span> “thread” provides the domain of meaning, while <span class="kanji-inline">充</span> serves as the phonetic. He notes that <span class="kanji-inline">充</span> depicts a person seen from the side with a distended belly, and in Shuowen it is explained through the idea of a <span class="kanji-inline">紀</span>, a spool or skein—the place where many threads collect. From this image of drawing numerous strands onto a single core, the character came to mean gathering things into one order: to bring together, to unify, and by extension to rule and control. That sense lives on in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">統</span><span class="kanji-inline">一</span> (unification), <span class="kanji-inline">統</span><span class="kanji-inline">制</span> (control), <span class="kanji-inline">統</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="理.html">理</a> (governance), <span class="kanji-inline">系</span><span class="kanji-inline">統</span> (an ordered system), and <span class="kanji-inline">統</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="括.html">括</a>・<span class="kanji-inline">統</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="轄.html">轄</a> (to oversee as a whole).</p>
