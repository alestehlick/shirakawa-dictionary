    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa analyzes <span class="kanji-inline">考</span> as a phono-semantic graph. Its core shape matches the upper part of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="老.html">老</a>, picturing the long hair of an elderly person seen in profile; to this a phonetic element supplying the sound kō was added. In its earliest sense the character named the deceased father, paired with <span class="kanji-inline">妣</span> for the deceased mother; the binome <span class="kanji-inline">考</span><span class="kanji-inline">妣</span> thus evokes parents who have passed away and, by association, the deep despondency of mourning. The familiar verbal senses—‘to think,’ ‘to compare,’ and ‘to examine’—developed later, following the kō reading and aligning with the sense of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="校.html">校</a>, and they came to dominate everyday usage.</p>
