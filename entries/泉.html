    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">泉</span> is a pictograph of water spilling down from a cliff face, the vivid image of a spring welling up to become a stream or river. The Shuowen already glosses it as water and by extension as a fountainhead, a spring, and spring water. When the cliff form <span class="kanji-inline">厂</span> is added to <span class="kanji-inline">泉</span>, it yields <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="原.html">原</a>, a graph likewise expressing the idea of an origin or source. The on reading sen matches that of <span class="kanji-inline">銭</span>, and in Wang Mang’s coinage the term <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貨.html">貨</a><span class="kanji-inline">泉</span> appeared; on some coins the inscription was artfully divided, rendering <span class="kanji-inline">泉</span> as the components <span class="kanji-inline">白</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">水</span> and splitting <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貨.html">貨</a> into <span class="kanji-inline">眞</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">人</span>.</p>
