    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">理</span> is a phono-semantic character: the jade element signals meaning, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="里.html">里</a> functions as the sound, giving the on reading ri. The Shuowen glosses it as “to govern, to prepare a jewel,” and the Han Feizi tale of Mr. He vividly illustrates its original action: “The king had a jade-cutter work the uncut stone.” In its earliest sense, <span class="kanji-inline">理</span> names the careful working of jade so that its natural veins emerge on the surface. From this craft-based image comes the broader idea of putting things in order—managing, polishing, rectifying—until their inherent pattern shows. Hence its later abstract sense of “principle,” the inner structure or grain that things possess by nature; this nuance survives in words like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肌.html">肌</a><span class="kanji-inline">理</span> (kiri), which speaks of the skin’s texture and, by extension, fine grain or pattern.</p>
