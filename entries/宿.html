    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">宿</span> is a compound graph built from the roof radical <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span> and a figure of a person lying on a mat, evoking a vigil kept through the night beneath the roof of an ancestral mausoleum. From this sacred scene of night watch the character came to mean lodging and dwelling—yadoru “to lodge,” yado “an inn,” and by extension a temporary stay. In ritual usage, <span class="kanji-inline">宿</span>る also described remaining in seclusion to observe abstinence before a ceremony. The sense of something that ‘stays on’ then widened to what is long held or long continued: long-cherished vows and intentions (<span class="kanji-inline">宿</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="願.html">願</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">宿</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="志.html">志</a>), people seasoned in learning (<span class="kanji-inline">宿</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="学.html">学</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">宿</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="儒.html">儒</a>), and influences that linger, such as an old grudge (<span class="kanji-inline">宿</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="恨.html">恨</a>) or a hangover that remains (<span class="kanji-inline">宿</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="酔.html">酔</a>). All derive from the original image of keeping presence through the night under a sacred roof.</p>
