    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of the heart, regarded in antiquity as the source of life and the seat of thought. Although the character itself does not appear in oracle-bone inscriptions, the oracle-bone form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="文.html">文</a> shows chest markings on a front-facing human figure, an emblem pointing to the heart. By the bronze inscription period, <span class="kanji-inline">心</span> is attested with moral and mental nuance, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="敬.html">敬</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="明.html">明</a><span class="kanji-inline">乃</span><span class="kanji-inline">心</span>, “Let your heart be made clear through reverence,” already expressing heart as mind, consideration, and the place where virtue takes root. The Japanese word kokoro originally evoked a “coagulating place,” where feelings and intentions gather and take form.</p>
