    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound ideograph built from a sacred sheep and two instances of the speech element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>. In its archaic form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> did not simply mean “speech”: it pictured a tattooing needle <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辛.html">辛</a> set over a covenant vessel (sai) that held prayers to the gods, and thus signified words sworn before the divine—oaths made under penalty of tattooing if broken. Placing two <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> on either side of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羊.html">羊</a> evokes the accuser and the accused taking oaths on the occasion of a divine ordeal, with the sacred sheep—likened to the discerning ‘divine dissection sheep’ (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="解.html">解</a><span class="kanji-inline">廌</span>)—set between them as judgment was sought. Originally a juridical term for this oath-taking rite, the graph came to express fulfilling the divine will, hence “good” and “right,” and by extension “excellent,” “skillful,” and even the sense of being on good terms.</p>
