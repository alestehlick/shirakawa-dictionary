    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a picto-phonetic compound that joins <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, the spoken words of a vow, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="折.html">折</a>, which originally depicts cutting plants or trees with an axe (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斤.html">斤</a>). That cutting was a solemn ritual gesture performed when swearing before the deities, and in the compound <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="折.html">折</a> both evokes the act and lends the sound (sei, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="逝.html">逝</a>). From this ritual setting the graph first meant “to swear to the gods,” and later broadened to the general senses “to swear” and “oath.” By extension it can also express the idea of being circumspect or refraining. Ancient rites also included snapping a consecrated arrow while making a vow; accordingly, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="矢.html">矢</a> could itself be read with the sense “to vow (chikau).”</p>
