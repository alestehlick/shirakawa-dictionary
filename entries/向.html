    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">向</span> as a graph built from a window-like frame and the square <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>, which here represents sai, the sacred container for covenantal writings offered to the gods. In the loess regions of northern China, semi-subterranean dwellings often had a single window, and the shaft of light entering that opening was felt as the advent of a deity. People placed offerings at the window to greet and worship the divine presence. Thus, the original sense of <span class="kanji-inline">向</span> is the window as a place of welcoming and veneration. Only later was the character used for <span class="kanji-inline">嚮</span>, extending to meanings such as to face, to turn toward, and by association, ahead or what lies before one.</p>
