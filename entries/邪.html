    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In early script, <span class="kanji-inline">邪</span> is a phono-semantic compound. It sets <span class="kanji-inline">牙</span>, the large curved tusk of an animal, as the phonetic, a graph that also suggests something bent or askew. The companion element <span class="kanji-inline">邑</span> depicts a walled settlement or fortress. Taken together they evoke a city wall that fails to make a true square—an oblique, out-of-true structure—and from this image the character comes to mean what is not in correct form, hence “evil,” “wrong.” The bent nuance of <span class="kanji-inline">牙</span> is seen also in a related graph where <span class="kanji-inline">牙</span> is placed within the clothing radical to describe garments worn askew. Thus the core idea is physical crookedness that extends to moral deviation.</p>
