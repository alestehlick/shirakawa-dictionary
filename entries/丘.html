    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally a pictograph, the character shows a hollow caught between two mountain slopes, suggesting the concave ground nestled in a range. Over time its sense shifted from that basin-like topography to the small swell of land we call a hill. Standing at the boundary between rise and hollow, it naturally appears in words that pair hills with ravines (<span class="kanji-inline">丘</span><span class="kanji-inline">壑</span>), and in the common term for rolling hill country (<span class="kanji-inline">丘</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="陵.html">陵</a>). In antiquity, such contours were attractive places to live; later they became favored sites for burial, reflected in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">丘</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="墳.html">墳</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">丘</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="墓.html">墓</a>, while the abandoned remains of former settlements were called <span class="kanji-inline">丘</span><span class="kanji-inline">墟</span>. The character thus preserves a landscape image even as its everyday meaning settles on the modest rise of a hill.</p>
