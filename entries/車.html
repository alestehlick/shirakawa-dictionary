    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph of a vehicle: the frame or chassis is drawn with a wheel at each side. It evokes the war chariots of ancient China, horse-drawn and typically pulled by a pair of horses, with which battles were fought. Craftsmanship in vehicle-making was already well developed, and the Zhou Rites’ Kao Gong Ji records the work of the vehicle craftsmen in detail. Chariot and horse pits excavated from Yin and Zhou tombs further testify to this culture of vehicles. From this concrete image of the chariot, the character came to mean vehicle or cart in general.</p>
