    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character pictures pieces of wood gathered and bound together: a bundle. From that image it means to bundle or tie up, and by extension a tied bundle itself. The act of fastening things together naturally evoked the broader idea of kessoku—binding with cord and, figuratively, the uniting of people of like intent. In ancient practice, a bundle of brushwood (sokushin) was offered to the gods and set adrift in a mountain stream for divination, and in legal proceedings both accuser and accused presented a bundle of arrows (sokushi). Such rites show how the notion of bundling came to signify solemn union and commitment.</p>
