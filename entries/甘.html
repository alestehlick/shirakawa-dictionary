    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In early script, <span class="kanji-inline">甘</span> is a pictograph of a lock with a key inserted—its original sense is “key” and, by extension, the act of setting or inlaying something in place. From this shape and idea of clamping or insertion arose related graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">拑</span>, which depicts holding the mouth shut, and <span class="kanji-inline">鉗</span>, for the metal shackles that restrain the neck or hands—implements of punishment. The familiar sense “sweet” appears to have been transferred to <span class="kanji-inline">甘</span> through association with <span class="kanji-inline">苷</span> and with <span class="kanji-inline">甘</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="草.html">草</a>, the licorice plant whose root has a notably sweet taste. Thus the character’s ancient image of a fitted lock later came to include the notion of sweetness.</p>
