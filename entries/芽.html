    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">芽</span> is a phono-semantic character built on <span class="kanji-inline">牙</span>, the tusk of an animal. <span class="kanji-inline">牙</span> contributes the on reading ga and suggests a form that is strong, sharp, and slightly curved. With the grass radical added above, that forceful image turns into the lively thrust of a shoot breaking through the soil, so the character comes to mean a bud or sprout. From this core sense arise uses such as megumu, “to put forth buds,” and, by extension, the notion of the first signs of something beginning to emerge.</p>
