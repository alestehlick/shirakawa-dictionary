    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">庭</span> is a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="廷.html">廷</a> serves as the phonetic, indicating the on reading tei, while <span class="kanji-inline">广</span> depicts the roof or eaves of a building. In early use, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="廷.html">廷</a> named the walled court of the imperial palace where rites were performed; by adding the roof element, <span class="kanji-inline">庭</span> came to mean the (court)yard adjoining a building. From that nucleus the sense broadened to any wide open grounds, as in <span class="kanji-inline">庭</span><span class="kanji-inline">園</span> “park” and <span class="kanji-inline">校</span><span class="kanji-inline">庭</span> “school grounds.” In modern usage the contrast is often explicit: <span class="kanji-inline">庭</span> typically evokes an open yard without a roof, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="廷.html">廷</a> is used for roofed official spaces, as in <span class="kanji-inline">法</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="廷.html">廷</a> “courtroom.”</p>
