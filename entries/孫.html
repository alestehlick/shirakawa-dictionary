    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a>, child, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="系.html">系</a>, a form showing hanging decorative strands. It portrays a child adorned with ritual tassels and serving as a katashiro, a substitute who stands in for the one being worshipped, in ancestral rites. Because a grandson acted as the personator for his paternal grandfather, the graph came to mean grandchild. As the Book of Rites (Ji Tong, Summary of Sacrifices) states: “In the way of sacrifice, the grandson serves as the personator of the grandfather.”</p>
