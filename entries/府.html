    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">府</span> is a phono-semantic character written under the “house” radical, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="付.html">付</a> supplying the sound. Early sources define it as a storehouse or repository: a place where important writings were safeguarded. The Zuo Zhuan notes that covenant texts were deposited in the Zhou fu—the royal archive and treasury of the Zhou dynasty—highlighting its role as the secure custodian of state documents. From this core sense it broadened to mean official premises and government offices, as in <span class="kanji-inline">府</span><span class="kanji-inline">署</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="官.html">官</a><span class="kanji-inline">府</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">政</span><span class="kanji-inline">府</span>; in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="首.html">首</a><span class="kanji-inline">府</span> it points to the seat of government, the capital.</p>
