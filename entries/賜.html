    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written with the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="易.html">易</a>, this was not the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="易.html">易</a> of “change” but a picture of ritual bestowal: wine being poured from the spout of a handled<span class="kanji-inline">爵</span> vessel, the flowing liquor clearly shown, and in some forms even both hands presenting the cup. In that early graph, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="易.html">易</a> supplied the sound shi while also evoking the act of conferring wine—“to grant.” As the notion broadened from ceremonial wine to the granting of goods in general, the cowry <span class="kanji-inline">貝</span>, the ancient sign of valuables and currency, was added to form <span class="kanji-inline">賜</span>. Later, the character <span class="kanji-inline">錫</span> (shaku) was also used with the sense “to bestow.” The elevated tone of this act survives in expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">賜</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="死.html">死</a>, “to grant death,” i.e., to order suicide.</p>
