    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">獄</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">狀</span>. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, in its ritual sense, shows an oath pronounced over a covenant vessel with a tattooing needle laid upon it—the speaker invokes the gods and vows to accept tattooing if the oath is false. <span class="kanji-inline">狀</span> represents the dog victims offered by both sides at the outset of a lawsuit. Together they depict the formal beginning of a trial: sacrificial dogs are presented and a solemn oath is sworn before the deities. From this original sense of adjudication, the character also came to mean a prison for holding the person judged guilty. While other legal graphs (such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="慶.html">慶</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="善.html">善</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="法.html">法</a>/<span class="kanji-inline">灋</span>) point to the sacred horned beast <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="解.html">解</a><span class="kanji-inline">廌</span> used in ordeals, <span class="kanji-inline">獄</span> preserves the memory that dogs, too, figured in these ritual proceedings.</p>
