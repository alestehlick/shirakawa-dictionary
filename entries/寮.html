    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the upper element is the roof of a large sacred building—like a shrine or mausoleum—while the phonetic is <span class="kanji-inline">燎</span> (ryo), depicting piled wood set ablaze, the ritual watch fire known as a courtyard fire (teiryo). From this, <span class="kanji-inline">寮</span> first denoted a sacred house that safeguarded the burning vigil flame, and by extension a public bureau or office and its staff. The related character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="僚.html">僚</a> names a person serving in such an office. Bronze inscriptions already mention bureaus such as the Dai Shi Ryo, responsible for worship, and the Kei Ji Ryo, in charge of administrative affairs. In Japan, -ryo labeled state offices like the Library Bureau (Tosho-ryo), the University Bureau (Daigaku-ryo), and the Court Music Bureau (Gagaku-ryo), and later the word came to mean a communal lodging for students or employees, a dormitory. <span class="kanji-inline">寮</span> also functions as a phonetic in characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">遼</span>, meaning “far, distant.”</p>
