    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as the image of flowing water, specifically a place where streams gather and surge onward as one forceful current. From that picture of a flow that continues far, it came to mean “long,” and especially “a long span of time.” By contrast, the form seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="派.html">派</a> depicts water dividing into separate channels, and so gives the sense of branching off.</p>
