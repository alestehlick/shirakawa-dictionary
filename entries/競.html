    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">競</span> is a compound formed by doubling <span class="kanji-inline">竞</span>. The element <span class="kanji-inline">竞</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">言</span>, words spoken as solemn vows or prayers, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="兄.html">兄</a>, understood here as a <span class="kanji-inline">祝</span> hafuri—an attendant who serves the gods. It pictures a ritual servant voicing petitions, and when doubled it shows two such officiants standing side by side in simultaneous prayer. From this image of paired, earnest supplication, it came to express vying or contending. The same ritual pairing appears in <span class="kanji-inline">巽</span>, which depicts two people dancing together as an offering to the gods, reflecting how sacred acts were often performed or witnessed in parallel by two.</p>
