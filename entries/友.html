    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">友</span> combines two instances of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>, the right hand, picturing hands joined in mutual help; from this image it came to mean a friend or companion, and by extension, to be intimate or to associate. In some bronze forms a small graph for a covenant vessel that held prayer writings to the gods (sai/etsu) is added, showing a hand laid upon it to swear an oath—an emblem of a mutual pledge of friendship. The compound <span class="kanji-inline">朋</span><span class="kanji-inline">友</span> in bronze inscriptions referred to fellow members of the same clan; here <span class="kanji-inline">朋</span> originally depicts two shells threaded together as a matched pair, a pairing metaphor later transferred to human relationships.</p>
