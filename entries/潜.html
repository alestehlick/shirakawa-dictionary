    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the water element indicates the aquatic setting, while the right-hand component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="替.html">替</a> serves as the phonetic, as seen in <span class="kanji-inline">僭</span> (sen), and also carries a sense of secrecy. Shirakawa explains <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="替.html">替</a> through a ritual image—two long ceremonial hairpins placed upon a sacred receptacle for written petitions—an act of covert cursing and slander, hence the nuance of doing something hidden from view. The older form <span class="kanji-inline">潛</span> already bore the on-reading sen. Joined to water, this idea of secrecy yields the core sense of slipping beneath the surface: to go underwater unseen, to dive or pass under, and by extension to hide oneself, to act quietly and in secret, even evoking depth.</p>
