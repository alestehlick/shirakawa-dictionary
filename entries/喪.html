    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In early forms, <span class="kanji-inline">喪</span> is composed of <span class="kanji-inline">哭</span>, the act of lamentation, joined with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="亡.html">亡</a>, the figure of the dead with limbs drawn in. In <span class="kanji-inline">哭</span>, the upper element shows a pair of covenant vessels set out for the gods, while below is a dog offered in sacrifice; this combination evokes ritual weeping before sacred offerings. Placed with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="亡.html">亡</a>, the whole depicts the funeral rite itself—vessels arrayed, a sacrificial dog presented, and mourners crying—hence the meanings of mourning and being in mourning, and by extension death. In bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">喪</span> also writes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="葬.html">葬</a>, “to bury,” as seen on the Mão Qi vessel, and oracle-bone texts ask about loss with phrases such as <span class="kanji-inline">喪</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衆.html">衆</a> “Will the people be lost?” and <span class="kanji-inline">喪</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="師.html">師</a> “Will the army be lost?” From these uses the character further develops senses like “to lose,” “to perish,” and “to destroy.”</p>
