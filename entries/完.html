    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">完</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span>, the roof of the ancestral mausoleum, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="元.html">元</a>, a figure marked by an emphasized head. Shirakawa reads the graph within the context of ancestral rites: beneath the mausoleum roof, the highlighted head evokes head-centered rituals such as the genpuku coming‑of‑age, when the hair was tied up and a coronet donned. In this same ritual sphere, <span class="kanji-inline">完</span> depicts the formal report of a warrior’s safe return after battle, offered before the ancestors in thanks for survival. From the idea of bringing affairs back under the protective roof and concluding them without harm, the character takes on the meanings of completing, carrying through to the end, and being whole or perfect. Related graphs like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="冠.html">冠</a> (the coronet of adulthood) and <span class="kanji-inline">寇</span> (an enemy ritually subdued at the mausoleum) confirm <span class="kanji-inline">完</span> as a character rooted in mausoleum ceremonies.</p>
