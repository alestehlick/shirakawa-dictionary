    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, this graph depicted an amputated bone; when the knife element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a> is added, it yields <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="切.html">切</a>, “to cut.” Its value as the numeral seven is a phonetic loan based on the sound. In ancient China, odd numbers were revered, and along with three and five, seven was regarded as sacred. Hence literary expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">七</span><span class="kanji-inline">発</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">七</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="啓.html">啓</a> do not enumerate books or chapters, but invoke the spell-like, consoling power of repeated recitation under the sign of seven.</p>
