    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">札</span> is formed by combining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>, “wood,” with a graphic element depicting a thin, flattened slat. The slat form was not used independently; with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> added to show the material, it yields the image of a narrow wooden tag. From such wooden tags on which characters were written, the character naturally came to mean a written piece or document. Because these slats could be scraped clean and reused, the office in charge of drafting and preparing texts was evocatively called the “knife-and-brush officials,” alluding to the pairing of scraping with a knife and writing with a brush.</p>
