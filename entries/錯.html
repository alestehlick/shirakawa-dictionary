    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the metal element signals the material, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="昔.html">昔</a> serves as the phonetic, as it also does in characters like <span class="kanji-inline">醋</span>. In ancient forms, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="昔.html">昔</a> depicts thin slices of meat laid out to dry in the sun; because such slices scatter and spread, the graph came to suggest thinness, scattering, and mingling. Applied to metalwork, <span class="kanji-inline">錯</span> describes polishing raw metal to bring out an inlaid design—carving and fitting precious metals into the surface—hence the sense “to polish.” From the image of lines and materials crossing and intermingling in inlay, the character extends to “to intersect,” “to be mixed up,” and, by further development, “to err.” In some compounds it substitutes for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="措.html">措</a> and is read so, as in <span class="kanji-inline">錯</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="意.html">意</a> (“attentive care”).</p>
