    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> marks speech, while <span class="kanji-inline">斥</span> functions as the phonetic, giving the on reading so. In early usage the character also appears as <span class="kanji-inline">愬</span>, which employs <span class="kanji-inline">朔</span> as its phonetic; <span class="kanji-inline">朔</span> contains <span class="kanji-inline">屰</span>, an inversion of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>—a figure with limbs outstretched—depicting someone coming from the opposite side. The Shuowen glosses it as “to tell, announce” (<span class="kanji-inline">告</span>), so the core sense is to come forward and report one’s case, hence to appeal or lodge a complaint, a meaning seen in legal compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">訴</span><span class="kanji-inline">訟</span>.</p>
