    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats <span class="kanji-inline">訴</span> as a phono‑semantic graph: the semantic side is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, “speech,” while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斥.html">斥</a> serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading so. Early analysis understands the phonetic element as a human figure seen from the opposite side, evoking someone coming forward to speak. The Shuowen glosses it as tsuguru, “to tell, to announce,” and from the idea of coming to report it developed the sense “to appeal, to lodge a complaint.” An older variant writes the word as <span class="kanji-inline">愬</span>, where <span class="kanji-inline">朔</span> functions as the phonetic marker. In later usage the character naturally extends to legal contexts, as in <span class="kanji-inline">訴</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="訟.html">訟</a>, “lawsuit.”</p>
