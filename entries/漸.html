    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the water element on the left signals wetness, while the right component <span class="kanji-inline">斬</span> serves as the phonetic and also hints at the idea of orderly progression. In <span class="kanji-inline">斬</span>, an axe (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斤.html">斤</a>) cuts wood step by step to make a cart (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="車.html">車</a>), implying a sequence of measured actions. Transferring that image to water, <span class="kanji-inline">漸</span> evokes moisture that seeps in and spreads little by little, hence meanings such as “to soak,” “to get wet,” and by extension “to advance” gradually. This leads to temporal uses like “gradually; at last,” as seen in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">漸</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="次.html">次</a>. The related character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="暫.html">暫</a> (“for a while”) likewise reflects time passing in gradual stages.</p>
