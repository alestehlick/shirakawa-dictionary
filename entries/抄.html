    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">抄</span> is a phono-semantic character: the hand component <span class="kanji-inline">扌</span> shows the act of taking, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="少.html">少</a> serves as the phonetic and points to its old image of small shells threaded on a cord—gathering scattered shells together. From this, the graph came to express a light, selective kind of taking, like scooping up small things, hence meanings such as “to scoop” and “to skim.” By extension it was used for making extracts and copies. In Japan, <span class="kanji-inline">抄</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="物.html">物</a> referred to Muromachi-period records of Zen monks’ lectures, valuable sources for the earliest forms of the spoken language.</p>
