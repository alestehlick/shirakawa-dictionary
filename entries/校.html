    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">校</span> sets <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="交.html">交</a> as its phonetic, a figure viewed from the front with legs crossed, and pairs it with wood to suggest crossed timbers at a roof. The image points to a purpose-built hall: in antiquity, a school where children of the nobility studied upon coming of age. The older form of “learning,” <span class="kanji-inline">學</span>, originally showed that same timbered school building; by adding a child within and a hand element, it came to express guiding and teaching. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">校</span> names the school as the physical place, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="学.html">学</a> the act of learning, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="教.html">教</a> the act of teaching conducted there. From the notion of checking and organizing within the school context, <span class="kanji-inline">校</span> also extended to the senses of comparing, consulting or planning, and counting.</p>
