    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">徑</span>, this is a phono-semantic compound. On the left stands <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, the “road” element (the left side of <span class="kanji-inline">行</span>), marking the sense of a way or path. On the right is <span class="kanji-inline">巠</span>, which supplies the sound kei and depicts the warp threads spread across a loom, straight lines drawn tight with a bar at the base—an image of linear extension. Together they express a direct, straight course: a shortcut compared with the ordinary road, hence a narrow path or trail. From this come usages such as <span class="kanji-inline">徯</span><span class="kanji-inline">径</span> for a small animal track and <span class="kanji-inline">捷</span><span class="kanji-inline">径</span> for a quick, easy method (with <span class="kanji-inline">捷</span> meaning swiftness). The character also carries the sense of doing something directly or at once, and appears in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="直.html">直</a><span class="kanji-inline">径</span>, “diameter.” A related form, <span class="kanji-inline">逕</span>, shares the same meaning.</p>
