    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">淨</span>, this is a phono‑semantic character with the water element giving the sense of washing and purification, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="争.html">争</a> serving as the phonetic. Early usage seems to have carried a nuance of “cold, chill”—as the Shuowen glosses a related graph as “sei, chill”—a natural association, since crystalline, pure water is felt as cold. The phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="争.html">争</a> also appears in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="静.html">静</a>(<span class="kanji-inline">靜</span>), whose bronze form shows hands grasping a plow‑like implement, depicting a rite to purify agricultural tools; by extension, <span class="kanji-inline">浄</span> may likewise have referred to a ritual of purifying an implement. From these ritual and sensory associations, the character came to mean “pure, clean” and “to cleanse,” and it is prominently used in Buddhist vocabulary, as in <span class="kanji-inline">浄</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a> (pure practice) and <span class="kanji-inline">浄</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> (the Pure Land).</p>
