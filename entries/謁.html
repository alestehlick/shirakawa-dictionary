    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">謁</span> combines the speech element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">曷</span>. Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">曷</span> not merely as a sound marker but as a ritual scene: a covenant receptacle shaped like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a> holding a written plea, set together with <span class="kanji-inline">匄</span>, the bones of the dead, to draw on their curse-spirit and make the petition effective. From this idea of addressing the gods with a formal request came the senses of asking, requesting, and reporting. With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> added, the character denotes voicing such a petition—hence the courtly act of seeking or being granted an audience, as in <span class="kanji-inline">謁</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="見.html">見</a>, presenting one’s plea before someone of high rank.</p>
