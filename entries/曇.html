    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">曇</span> combines the elements for sun (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>) and cloud (<span class="kanji-inline">雲</span>), depicting sunlight being veiled by clouds. From this image it naturally came to mean to cloud over and cloudiness. It appears in words such as donten, a cloudy sky, and the classical binome <span class="kanji-inline">曇</span><span class="kanji-inline">曇</span> for a dark, heavily overcast day. In Buddhist literature it is also seen in Udonge (<span class="kanji-inline">優</span><span class="kanji-inline">曇</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="華.html">華</a>), the udumbara, a legendary flower said to bloom only once in three thousand years.</p>
