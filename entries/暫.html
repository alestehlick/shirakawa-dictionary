    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: <span class="kanji-inline">斬</span> provides the on reading zan and originally described cutting a felled tree into parts, piece by piece, in the fixed order used for making a vehicle. From this sense of orderly, successive progression came <span class="kanji-inline">漸</span>, “to soak and become gradually wet.” With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>—the sun/day—added below to mark time, <span class="kanji-inline">暫</span> carries that notion over to the flow of time: time that passes in measured succession, hence a short while, a brief moment.</p>
