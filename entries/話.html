    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">話</span> as a phono-semantic graph: the left side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> marks speech, while the right side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舌.html">舌</a> supplies the sound and preserves an ancient ritual image. In early forms, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舌.html">舌</a> depicts a small handled blade thrust into a covenant vessel (sai) that held written petitions to the gods; by piercing and scraping them away, the prayer’s power was annulled. Built on this image, <span class="kanji-inline">話</span> originally evoked speech that cuts and harms—words of censure, slander, or malicious talk. From there its use broadened to ordinary speaking and conversation. Its phonetic kin, such as <span class="kanji-inline">訛</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">獪</span>, likewise cluster around senses of deceptive or crafty speech, confirming this early nuance.</p>
