    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a hand held palm-down, with the thumb and middle finger stretched to their full span: the upper stroke suggests the wrist, while the forked <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="八.html">八</a> below renders the two outstretched digits. In traditional measures, a sun is the width of one finger, and ten sun make a shaku. From this, the graph names the shaku (about 0.303 m), and by extension a measuring rod or anything of shaku length; because it depicts only a modest span, it can also suggest “small” or “few.” In classical Japanese, this span is called ata, as in Yata no Kagami, though it is a distinct measure, and tsuka (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="束.html">束</a>) denotes the breadth of four fingers.</p>
