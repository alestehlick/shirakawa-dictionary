    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">觀</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">雚</span> depicts a sacred stork used in bird divination, and with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="見.html">見</a> it evokes the act of watching to discern the gods’ will. In this early setting—closely associated with agricultural rites like those reflected in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勧.html">勧</a>—the character conveyed divinatory observation and careful discrimination. Over time its sense broadened to ordinary seeing, viewing, and close examination. It could also denote a tall lookout building from which one surveys the distance.</p>
