    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">貯</span> as a phono-semantic graph built on <span class="kanji-inline">宁</span>, which depicts a storage box and also supplies the sound value cho. In oracle-bone forms the box is shown with cowry shells placed inside; some bronze forms instead depict a pike set within the box. Because the cowry (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>) was a precious shell used as money, adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a> to the “box” graph naturally yields the sense of laying valuables by in store. Bronze inscriptions even use <span class="kanji-inline">貯</span> as a noun for a storage facility, as in an order to oversee the construction of a new storehouse. From these early images the character came to mean to store, to lay up, and by extension savings.</p>
