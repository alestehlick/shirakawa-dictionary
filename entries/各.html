    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">各</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">夂</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">囗</span>: <span class="kanji-inline">夂</span> is an inverted footprint that signifies descent from above, while <span class="kanji-inline">囗</span> is the ritual receptacle sai into which written prayers to the deities were placed. The graph thus pictures a god coming down in answer to those petitions, giving the original sense itaru, to arrive or come. This sacred descent underlies related graphs: <span class="kanji-inline">召</span> denotes the act of calling and inviting the deity to descend (and became the base of <span class="kanji-inline">招</span>), and characters containing <span class="kanji-inline">各</span> often carry the nuance of reaching or arriving; <span class="kanji-inline">路</span>, for example, refers to ritually purifying the streets through kami-oroshi, the drawing down of the divine. Because <span class="kanji-inline">各</span> depicts the descent of a single deity—by contrast with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皆.html">皆</a>, which shows all the gods descending in line—it naturally developed the meaning “each,” “one by one,” and “respective.”</p>
