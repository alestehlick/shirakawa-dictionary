    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its original form <span class="kanji-inline">戲</span>, the graph combines <span class="kanji-inline">盧</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a> to picture a performer wrapped in a tiger hide, seated on a high-footed <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="豆.html">豆</a>-like bench, while a halberd is brought down from behind. This scene evokes a ritual court dance that imitated a martial deity and was performed as a prayer for victory. From that setting the character came to designate military formations—the left and right wings of the army—and even simply “to fight.” As the victory-pleading pageant came to be seen as theatrical posturing, the word naturally shifted to meanings such as play, sport, jesting, and teasing.</p>
