    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa traces <span class="kanji-inline">犠</span> to the older form <span class="kanji-inline">犧</span>, a phono-semantic compound in which <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="牛.html">牛</a> “ox” gives the sacrificial sense and <span class="kanji-inline">羲</span> supplies the sound (gi) along with vivid imagery. In <span class="kanji-inline">羲</span>, a sheep offered in ritual is cut open and inspected with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="我.html">我</a> “saw,” its severed hind legs hanging down—an image of ensuring that both the outward form and the inner organs are without flaw. When those hanging legs are omitted the form is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="義.html">義</a>, which he takes as the original graph for a sacrificial sheep. Because ox offerings were regarded as the most important, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="牛.html">牛</a> was added to create <span class="kanji-inline">犧</span>, and the character came to mean a sacrificial offering more broadly, extending beyond sheep to oxen, pigs, and other animals.</p>
