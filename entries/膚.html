    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: in early usage it appears as <span class="kanji-inline">臚</span>, with <span class="kanji-inline">盧</span> serving as the sound indicator. The Shuowen glosses <span class="kanji-inline">臚</span> as <span class="kanji-inline">皮</span> “skin” and also cites the form <span class="kanji-inline">膚</span>; in bronze inscriptions, the graph is written <span class="kanji-inline">膚</span> and seems to be the original shape. In archaic verse <span class="kanji-inline">膚</span> rhymes with <span class="kanji-inline">胡</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a>, indicating it once followed the <span class="kanji-inline">盧</span> series in pronunciation before settling into the later on-reading fu. Its basic sense is “skin,” and from the thinness of the skin (as in <span class="kanji-inline">皮</span><span class="kanji-inline">膚</span>) comes a figurative use for what is thin or superficial (<span class="kanji-inline">膚</span><span class="kanji-inline">薄</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">膚</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="浅.html">浅</a>). <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="完.html">完</a><span class="kanji-inline">膚</span> names intact, uninjured skin and by extension an undamaged state, giving rise to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="完.html">完</a><span class="kanji-inline">膚</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="無.html">無</a>きまで, “to the point that no uninjured skin remains,” meaning thoroughly or to the last degree.</p>
