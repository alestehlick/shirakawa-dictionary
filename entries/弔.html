    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest guise, <span class="kanji-inline">弔</span> is a pictograph of the cord of a throwing javelin coiled around a bow—the tethered dart that, when cast, twists around and catches birds. Over time, the dedicated graph <span class="kanji-inline">繳</span> came to represent the sense “javelin cord,” and <span class="kanji-inline">弔</span>, from the Warring States period onward, was used for “to mourn, to offer condolences.” Forms understood as combining a person with a bow recall an old funerary scene: after leaving the dead exposed to weather, people would later go to collect the bones, carrying a bow to drive off wild animals—an act that naturally came to signify mourning the departed. A phonetic link also colors its usage: the on-reading associated with <span class="kanji-inline">繳</span> (zhuo/shaku) aligns with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="淑.html">淑</a> (shu/shuku, “good”), so <span class="kanji-inline">弔</span> could bear the nuance of being in favor or not. This helps explain phrases like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="不.html">不</a><span class="kanji-inline">弔</span> in the Book of Odes as “ill-starred, not granted Heaven’s aid,” that is, misfortune.</p>
