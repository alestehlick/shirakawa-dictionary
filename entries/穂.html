    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character built on <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span> “grain” with a phonetic element. The original form was <span class="kanji-inline">穗</span>, using <span class="kanji-inline">惠</span> as the phonetic; a later variant <span class="kanji-inline">穟</span> used <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遂.html">遂</a> as the phonetic, and from this the on reading sui became established and was also applied to <span class="kanji-inline">穂</span>. Bronze forms show the component later written as <span class="kanji-inline">惠</span> depicting three grain spikes sprouting from seeds, vividly evoking the cereal ear; hence the meaning “ear (spike)” and, by extension, “tip of a spike.” In <span class="kanji-inline">穂</span> this <span class="kanji-inline">惠</span> is that ancient graphic form and is distinct from the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="恵.html">恵</a> that means “mercy.”</p>
