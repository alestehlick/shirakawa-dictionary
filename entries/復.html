    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">復</span> is a phono-semantic character. On the right, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夏.html">夏</a> serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading fuku; it originally depicts an inverted measuring vessel used for gauging capacity. On the left is <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, the “road” sign, which is the left half of <span class="kanji-inline">行</span>, the crossroads graph. With the road determinative added to the phonetic, the character comes to mean returning along a way—going back to the origin. From this core sense develop the ideas of repaying and doing something again, as reflected in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">復</span><span class="kanji-inline">讐</span> (vengeance), <span class="kanji-inline">報</span><span class="kanji-inline">復</span> (retaliation), and <span class="kanji-inline">反</span><span class="kanji-inline">復</span> (repetition).</p>
