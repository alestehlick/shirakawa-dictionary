    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This graph began as the picture of a footprint—one form for the right step, another for the left. It is the upper element of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="歩.html">歩</a>, which depicts left and right steps alternating to show walking. From the sense of pressing strength into the legs and impressing a firm step, <span class="kanji-inline">止</span> came to mean to stop, stay, or remain. By adding the foot/leg classifier <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="足.html">足</a> to <span class="kanji-inline">止</span>, scribes created <span class="kanji-inline">趾</span>, the character for a footprint, with <span class="kanji-inline">止</span> as the original graph and <span class="kanji-inline">趾</span> as its semantic elaboration. In oracle-bone and turtle-plastron inscriptions, the forms for <span class="kanji-inline">止</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">之</span> are alike, both tracing a single step to indicate leg movement; <span class="kanji-inline">之</span> developed the meaning to go or advance, and its later use as the pronoun this is a loan application.</p>
