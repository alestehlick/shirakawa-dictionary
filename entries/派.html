    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">派</span> as a phono-semantic character: the water radical indicates the domain of meaning, while <span class="kanji-inline">辰</span> serves as the phonetic and, in its earliest form, depicts water splitting into branches—the original image behind <span class="kanji-inline">派</span>. With “water” added, the character names the act of flow dividing and spreading: to branch off and flow, to branch off, and by extension to send out or dispatch. He links it to related water graphs: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="永.html">永</a> marks a place where currents converge with force, and <span class="kanji-inline">漾</span> (yō, ‘to drift, float’) evokes the abiding vigor carried downstream. From this image of a stream dividing from the main current arose the later sense of a faction or school.</p>
