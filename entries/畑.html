    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A Japanese-coined character formed by combining the graphs for fire and rice field, evoking land made arable by burning—slash-and-burn plots known as yakihata. It designates non‑irrigated fields, dry upland ground opened by burning grass, in contrast to the flooded rice paddies written <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a>. It is also written <span class="kanji-inline">畠</span>. This sense is preserved in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">畑</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="地.html">地</a> (farmland for fields) and <span class="kanji-inline">畑</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="作.html">作</a> (dry-field farming and the crops produced by it).</p>
