    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">沈</span> is a phono-semantic compound: the water element signals the domain of meaning, while the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">冘</span> points to the on reading and appears in kindred characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">枕</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">鴆</span>. In the oracle-bone form it is a pictograph showing an ox or sheep in water, reflecting the ancient rite of sinking a sacrificial animal in a river, especially in times of flood. From this concrete image of a river-sinking offering, the character broadened in sense to “sink” and “submerge,” and by extension to being buried, hidden or latent, growing quiet, and settling down or becoming absorbed. As a counterpart to the river offering signified by <span class="kanji-inline">沈</span>, there was also the earth-burying rite written <span class="kanji-inline">霾</span>; together they were spoken of as <span class="kanji-inline">沈</span><span class="kanji-inline">霾</span>, the paired practices of sinking in water and burying in soil.</p>
