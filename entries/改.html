    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">改</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">巳</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>. In early forms, <span class="kanji-inline">巳</span> does not mean “self,” but represents a gu vessel packed with noxious creatures and shaped like coiled snakes, an instrument used in cursing rituals. When paired with <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>, the hand that strikes, the graph depicts a rite of beating the vessel to drive off and divert the misfortune trying to cling to one’s person. From this exorcistic act of altering one’s lot, <span class="kanji-inline">改</span> came to mean to reform, renew, and improve. Later script traditions sometimes treated it as a phono-semantic graph, but the archaic forms preserve its origin in a ritual of purification and change.</p>
