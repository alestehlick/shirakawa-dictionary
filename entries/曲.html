    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a basket woven from thinned strips of bamboo or vine. The image of those pliant, bent ribs crossing in a lattice gives the core sense of turning and bending, hence “to bend” and “to be bent,” and by extension the idea of something intricately worked—exact and detailed. From the notion of crookedness it also acquires a moral nuance of “wrong” or “wicked,” as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">枉</span><span class="kanji-inline">曲</span>. In later usage it came to name a musical piece, a tune or melody.</p>
