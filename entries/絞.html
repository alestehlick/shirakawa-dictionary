    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">絞</span> is a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a> supplies the sense of threads and binding, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="交.html">交</a> (kou) acts as the phonetic and, in its old form, depicts a person seen from the front with legs crossed, expressing the idea of crossing. Early lexicography glosses the core meaning as kubiru—throttling the throat—hence compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">絞</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="首.html">首</a> for killing by strangulation and <span class="kanji-inline">絞</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="首.html">首</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刑.html">刑</a> for that form of punishment. From the notion of crossing and tightening threads it also means shimeru, to tie tight, and in Japanese extends to shiboru, to wring or squeeze, as seen in shiborizome (tie-dyeing by binding cloth with thread), shiborikasu (strained lees or residue), and the figurative chie o shiboru, to wring out one’s wits.</p>
