    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">穀</span> is a phono-semantic character. In early forms, the element <span class="kanji-inline">殼</span> functions as the phonetic, pointing to the on-reading and sketching the husk left after threshing — an empty shell with scraps still clinging inside. With <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span>, the grain plant, added, the whole graph presents cereal grains enclosed in their husks, and so came to mean cereals and grain in general. A related figure, <span class="kanji-inline">穆</span>, shows the grain-bearing ear swelling and about to burst, reinforcing the image of ripening crops. Because cereals sustain human life, the character naturally extends to the senses of nourishing, rearing, and living.</p>
