    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">劍</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the blade element (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a>) provides the meaning ‘sword,’ while <span class="kanji-inline">僉</span> serves as the phonetic, signaling the on reading and appearing likewise in words such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="検.html">検</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="験.html">験</a>. The Shuowen glosses it as a weapon worn at a man’s belt, the sword carried at the waist (taiken). Specifically, <span class="kanji-inline">剣</span> denotes a tsurugi, a straight, double‑edged sword, in contrast to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a>, which is single‑edged. In Chinese antiquity, the celebrated double‑edged swords of the southern states Wu and Yue were especially renowned.</p>
