    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">分</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">八</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a>. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">八</span> shows something split into left and right, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a> is the blade that performs the cut. Together they depict dividing an object into two, which underlies the senses “to divide,” “to separate,” and “to branch off” seen in wakeru, wakatsu, and wakareru. Classical glosses simply define it as “to separate.” The related character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="別.html">別</a> originally evokes cutting at the joints with a knife, and from this combination comes the idea of <span class="kanji-inline">分</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="別.html">別</a>—discriminating by kind. In Japanese the meaning naturally extends to wakaru, “to understand,” since understanding is the ability to make clear distinctions, as in the phrase “a person who understands reason.”</p>
