    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">造</span> is a compound character whose early forms join an offering tray with the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="告.html">告</a>, which depicts fixing a receptacle for covenant texts to a tree branch and presenting it before the gods in prayer. In related forms this ritual is shown being carried out at the ancestral mausoleum, and with the movement element added (the walking radical), it specifically pictures going to the mausoleum to perform the rite. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">造</span> originally carried the sense itaru: to arrive and pay a devotional visit. The character later streamlines that older form, and its range of meaning widens: in bronze inscriptions it appears with nasu and nashitogeru—“to do, to accomplish”—and also with tsukuru—“to make, to produce.” The compound <span class="kanji-inline">造</span><span class="kanji-inline">詣</span> preserves the older nuance of “arriving at” profound attainment, referring to deep, well-developed mastery in an art or a field.</p>
