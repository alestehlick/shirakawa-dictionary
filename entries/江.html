    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">江</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water element signals a body of water, while the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="工.html">工</a> (kō) contributes the sound and, in Shirakawa’s view, evokes a gently arched, rainbow-like curve (as seen also in <span class="kanji-inline">虹</span>). In Chinese usage, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="河.html">河</a> was used for northern rivers and <span class="kanji-inline">江</span> for southern ones; the name <span class="kanji-inline">江</span> is already attested in the Book of Odes and the Book of Documents, and Qin bronze inscriptions refer to the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="長.html">長</a><span class="kanji-inline">江</span> simply as <span class="kanji-inline">江</span>. This likely reflects the long-recognized sweeping curve of the Yangtze from its middle to lower reaches. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">江</span> came to mean “river,” and by extension the Yangtze itself. In Japanese it is also read e in words like irie, “inlet.”</p>
