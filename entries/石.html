    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound of the cliff form <span class="kanji-inline">厂</span> and a ritual container <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>/<span class="kanji-inline">囗</span> known as the sai, a box for depositing written prayers to the gods. In early script it evokes a great rock by a cliff that was revered as the dwelling place of a divine spirit, with petitions offered in that covenant receptacle. Shuowen glosses it as a “mountain stone,” and over time the sense broadened to the general meaning of “stone.” Related graphs preserve this cultic background: <span class="kanji-inline">祏</span> denotes the spirit tablet set in an ancestral mausoleum, and <span class="kanji-inline">宕</span> names the “stone chamber” where the Son of Heaven performed rites to heaven and earth, all testifying to an ancient faith centered on sacred stones.</p>
