    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">虚</span> is a phono-semantic character. The upper element <span class="kanji-inline">虍</span> functions as the phonetic, giving the reading ko, and its lower strokes originally formed the shape of a hill <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丘.html">丘</a>. In antiquity, cities were established on hills and contained sacred precincts and cemeteries; when a city fell, what remained were the mounded sites of buildings and graves. From this image, <span class="kanji-inline">虚</span> signified the desolate remains of a city—later also written with <span class="kanji-inline">墟</span>—and, through usage in words like <span class="kanji-inline">廃</span><span class="kanji-inline">墟</span>, its sense broadened to what is absent or no longer present. Hence it came to mean empty or in vain, and by further extension, that which lacks substance—falsehood or a lie.</p>
