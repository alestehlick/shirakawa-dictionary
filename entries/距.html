    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">距</span> as a phono-semantic character built on the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="巨.html">巨</a> (kyo). <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="巨.html">巨</a> originally depicts a carpenter’s square bent at a right angle, a shape likened to a rooster’s spur; because one arm juts out and does not align with the other, it came to suggest refusing to fit, then resisting, standing apart, and the sense of a gap or estrangement. In compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鶏.html">鶏</a><span class="kanji-inline">距</span> it names the cock’s spur itself. With this image of protrusion and misalignment as its core, <span class="kanji-inline">距</span> develops meanings like to keep separate, to move away, and to differ—hence the idea of distance.</p>
