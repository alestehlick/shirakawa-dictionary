    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats this as a phono-semantic character whose original form was written <span class="kanji-inline">遵</span>, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尊.html">尊</a> serving as the phonetic. The Shuowen already explains it in terms of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="循.html">循</a>, “to follow,” and the two related graphs illuminate how the meaning arose. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="循.html">循</a> depicts moving in a circuit with a raised shield, evoking a military tour used to pacify territory (as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="循.html">循</a><span class="kanji-inline">撫</span>). <span class="kanji-inline">遵</span> shows proceeding in a circuit while holding up a wine vessel, a ritual procession of offering that compels observance. From these complementary images—military and ritual—emerges the sense of being led or made to accompany, and thus the core meaning “to follow, to obey,” preserved in <span class="kanji-inline">順</span>.</p>
