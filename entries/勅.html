    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character brings together <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="束.html">束</a>, the image of brushwood tied in a bundle, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a>, the plow. In its older counterpart <span class="kanji-inline">敕</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="束.html">束</a> is paired with <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">攵</span>), the sign of striking or arranging. The composite evokes a purification rite in which a bundle of brushwood is handled—set in order, even struck—so that disorder is corrected. From this ritual sense of putting things right arise the meanings “to admonish” and “to correct,” and, by extension, the graph came to denote an imperial command. Today <span class="kanji-inline">勅</span> serves as the standard form for that older <span class="kanji-inline">敕</span>, and it is used for ‘mikotonori,’ the emperor’s edict, and for words connected with affairs of the Son of Heaven.</p>
