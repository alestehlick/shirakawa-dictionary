    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">教</span> as a compound centered on <span class="kanji-inline">爻</span>, the crossed rafters of a sacred building, joined with <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>, the whip or urging stick. In <span class="kanji-inline">斈</span>—the old form that underlies <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="学.html">学</a>—the same rafters shelter <span class="kanji-inline">子</span>, the children learning within; <span class="kanji-inline">教</span> replaces the child with the urging hand/rod to show an elder driving on the learners under those sacred eaves. The crossed-wood roof motif survives in Shinto architecture as a mark of sanctity, and in antiquity noble youths gathered in such sanctuaries to receive training in tradition and ceremony from senior elders. From this ritualized scene of instruction comes the meaning “to teach.”</p>
