    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">歌</span> as a phono-semantic character. Its phonetic is <span class="kanji-inline">哥</span> (ka), a doubling of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="可.html">可</a>. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="可.html">可</a> portrays striking the covenant vessel (sai), into which petitions to the gods were placed, with a stick (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丁.html">丁</a>) to press the gods to grant the request—hence its senses of “it should” and “it is permitted.” The semantic is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="欠.html">欠</a>, a figure with mouth open in vocalization. In ritual prayer this urging became rhythmic, and <span class="kanji-inline">歌</span> names the melody of that insistent voice, coming to mean both “to sing” and “song.” He even links the native uta to utsu “to beat” and uttau “to press a plea.” Related words refine the nuance: <span class="kanji-inline">詠</span> suggests a drawn-out, sustained style; <span class="kanji-inline">歌</span> the forceful singing that presses one’s petition; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="謡.html">謡</a> (artistic song) evokes singing while offering meat to coax the gods; and <span class="kanji-inline">唱</span> denotes choral chanting. An older form is <span class="kanji-inline">謌</span>.</p>
