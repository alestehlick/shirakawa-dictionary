    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">罰</span> is a compound graph built from the component <span class="kanji-inline">詈</span>—depicting a net laid over words—and the knife radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a>. <span class="kanji-inline">詈</span> shows the words of a solemn oath symbolically covered and rendered void by a net; with the addition of a knife, the image becomes one of cutting that oath to pieces. The character thus originally signifies tearing up and annulling an oath made to the gods, and by extension the blame and chastisement visited upon those who lie before the divine. The Book of Documents (Speech of Tang) uses the phrase <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="致.html">致</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="天.html">天</a><span class="kanji-inline">之</span><span class="kanji-inline">罰</span>, “to carry out Heaven’s punishment,” reflecting <span class="kanji-inline">罰</span> in its first sense as Heaven’s retribution; only later did it broaden to denote legal penalties imposed on offenders.</p>
