    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">古</span> is a compound sign joining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="十.html">十</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="十.html">十</a> is a shortened form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="干.html">干</a>, the rectangular sacred shield, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> represents the covenant vessel (sai) into which written prayers to the deity were placed. Setting the shield upon this vessel signifies safeguarding and preserving the efficacy of those prayers over a long span, which gives the character its meanings of “old,” “from of old,” and “antiquity.” When <span class="kanji-inline">囗</span> (an enclosure) is added to <span class="kanji-inline">古</span>, it forms <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="固.html">固</a>, expressing the enclosing and firming of that preserved power—“hard, solid.” When <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span> (to strike) is added, it becomes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="故.html">故</a>, an act that violates that preservation, hence “deliberately, on purpose.”</p>
