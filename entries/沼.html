    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the water element on the left signals a body of standing water, while the component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="召.html">召</a> (read shō) supplies the sound. In the Book of Odes, the phrase Ling Zhao, “Spirit Lake,” refers to the broad lake by the Spirit Tower at the ritual capital Piyong, where the deity was welcomed. The poem evokes the king by that wondrous pond, alive with leaping fish. From such ritual associations, a swamp or pond was regarded as a dwelling place of numinous presence, and the very name <span class="kanji-inline">沼</span> retains a quiet sense of sacredness.</p>
