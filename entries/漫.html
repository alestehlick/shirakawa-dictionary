    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with the water element and the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">曼</span>. <span class="kanji-inline">曼</span> depicts a hand drawing down a headscarf worn deep over the head so that the eyes appear, and by extension evokes the luxuriant, expansive beauty of a woman’s eyes. With water added, the graph comes to picture water spreading without bounds—an expansive, level mass—and is used for senses such as wide, spreading out, and, by extension, acting at random or without restraint.</p>
