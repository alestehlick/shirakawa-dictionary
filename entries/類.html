    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its original form, <span class="kanji-inline">類</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="米.html">米</a> “rice,” <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a> “dog,” and <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span>, which here portrays a figure in formal posture, hair bound and crowned for ritual. The graph pictures a worshipper, ceremonially attired and bowing, presenting rice and a dog as a sacrificial offering in a festival directed to Heaven. In rites to the Supreme Deity, the dog was roasted so that its fragrance would rise to the sky—a sense reflected in the Book of Documents, Shun Canon: <span class="kanji-inline">肆</span><span class="kanji-inline">類</span><span class="kanji-inline">于</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="上.html">上</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="帝.html">帝</a>, “he offered a special<span class="kanji-inline">類</span>-sacrifice to the Highest.” Later standardization replaced the dog component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a> with the human figure <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>, obscuring the original act of canine sacrifice, and the character broadened in use to mean “to be alike” and “kind, sort.” When the altar sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a> is added to this graph, it yields <span class="kanji-inline">禷</span> (read rui), preserving the older, specifically ritual meaning of worship.</p>
