    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">淺</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the water element adds the sense of water, while <span class="kanji-inline">戔</span> serves as the phonetic, yielding the On reading sen. <span class="kanji-inline">戔</span> depicts long, narrow pikes (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>) stacked up, suggesting a state of things being thin and scant. With water added, the primary sense is water that is shallow, which then broadened to shallow in general, as well as thin or slight and few or little. Applied to people, it further came to describe a superficial, thoughtless, or foolish disposition.</p>
