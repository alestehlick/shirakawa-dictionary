    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">隱</span>, this is a picto-phonetic character with in as its phonetic. It portrays a worshiper holding a ritual curse implement in both hands—the upper hand indicated by <span class="kanji-inline">爪</span> and the lower by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>—offering a secret prayer before <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span>, understood as the divine ladder by which the gods ascend and descend. From this scene of god-facing concealment arises the core sense of hiding and keeping things secret, and by extension acting discreetly so that no one knows.</p>
