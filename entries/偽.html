    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, originally written <span class="kanji-inline">僞</span>, it sets the person sign beside <span class="kanji-inline">爲</span>, which provides the sound and functions as the on-reading indicator. In its earliest sense, the character did not center on lying but on transformation: it described changing into and becoming something different, much like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="化.html">化</a>, and was once used interchangeably with <span class="kanji-inline">訛</span>. As usage developed, the meaning moved from the idea of the artificial or provisional (karigi) to the concrete sense of deception and fraud (gisa). Hence its present use for falsehood, a fake, and to lie.</p>
