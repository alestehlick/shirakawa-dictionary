    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa views <span class="kanji-inline">住</span> as a picto-phonetic graph centered on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="主.html">主</a>, which here serves as the sound element and depicts a lamplight: the dot marks the heart of the flame, with the tallow tray and its pedestal beneath. The lamplight’s upright stand evokes a pillar, and from the image of pillars set in line comes the sense of a house frame—a place where people live. Thus the character means sumu, to live, and sumau, to continue living, and by extension also carries the idea of remaining or staying, as reflected in words like <span class="kanji-inline">住</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="居.html">居</a>, a dwelling where one stays for a long time.</p>
