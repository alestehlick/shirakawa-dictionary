    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph ultimately tied to the plow. In the graph <span class="kanji-inline">耜</span> (suki, plow), the left element <span class="kanji-inline">耒</span> shows the handled, forked-topped plow, while the right element depicts the rounded cutting edge of its blade; that rounded edge appears in early forms as <span class="kanji-inline">巳</span>, as <span class="kanji-inline">以</span>, or as a triangular variant. In Shang–Zhou usage a form written as <span class="kanji-inline">台</span> was used for <span class="kanji-inline">以</span>te (with, by means of) by adding the covenant vessel that held prayer texts to the plow sign, expressing the idea of using the plow after ritually purifying it to ward off harm such as insect damage. The vessel element was later omitted, yielding the present form <span class="kanji-inline">以</span>. The same <span class="kanji-inline">台</span> form also served as a first-person pronoun (ware, I) in ancient texts.</p>
