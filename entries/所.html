    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">所</span> is a compound graph of <span class="kanji-inline">戶</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斤.html">斤</a>. <span class="kanji-inline">戶</span> depicts the single-leaf door of a household altar (in contrast to the double-leaf gate <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a>), while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斤.html">斤</a> is an adze. The character pictures the altar door secured and protected with the adze; within that door a seat was prepared for the spirit of the deceased or a deity. Bronze inscriptions preserve this sacral sense in phrases such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="帝.html">帝</a><span class="kanji-inline">所</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="雷.html">雷</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="公.html">公</a><span class="kanji-inline">之</span><span class="kanji-inline">所</span>, meaning the consecrated place of a god or an ancestral spirit. From this core meaning of a sacred ‘place,’ the word broadened to denote the ruler’s palace—the imperial dwelling—and then more generally any place or social position. By association with the on-reading of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="許.html">許</a>, it also developed the adverbial sense ‘only’ (bakari), and in classical usage it appears as a contraction of <span class="kanji-inline">之</span><span class="kanji-inline">於</span>, functioning as a relative or locative marker in emphatic constructions.</p>
