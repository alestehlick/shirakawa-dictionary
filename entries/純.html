    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">純</span> as a phono-semantic compound: the silk radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a> points to textiles, while the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="屯.html">屯</a> originally depicted a tassel where the threads of a cloth are gathered and tied off at the edge. From this image of threads stopping and being fastened at the border came the notion of a decorated hem or border ornament. Bronze inscriptions record gifts described with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="屯.html">屯</a> in this sense—such as black garments adorned with edge tassels and ceremonial robes with embroidered borders—and even use <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="屯.html">屯</a> with the value of “pure, genuine.” Building on this textile image of threads gathered without admixture, <span class="kanji-inline">純</span> came to mean “pure, unmixed, genuine,” and later extended toward senses of completeness or exclusivity, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="屯.html">屯</a> itself shifted in use toward “to gather.”</p>
