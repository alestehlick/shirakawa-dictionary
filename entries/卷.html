    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form <span class="kanji-inline">卷</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">釆</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">廾</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">巳</span> to picture an act of coiling: with <span class="kanji-inline">廾</span>, two hands, one rolls up what <span class="kanji-inline">釆</span> suggests as a clawed hide or forepaw, bending it over into the curved shape evoked by <span class="kanji-inline">巳</span>. From this concrete image comes the sense “to wind, roll up,” and by extension “to bend or turn.” Related characters echo facets of this motion: <span class="kanji-inline">捲</span> names the very act of rolling up; <span class="kanji-inline">眷</span> suggests turning back as if curling oneself; <span class="kanji-inline">惓</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">倦</span> portray the loosening of one’s stance when wearied. Because early writings were made into rolls bound in leather or silk, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="書.html">書</a><span class="kanji-inline">卷</span> came to mean a written work or book; even after paper codices became standard, the term <span class="kanji-inline">卷</span> (modern <span class="kanji-inline">巻</span>) remained for numbering and dividing volumes.</p>
