    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound of shi <span class="kanji-inline">尸</span> and shi <span class="kanji-inline">至</span>. Here <span class="kanji-inline">尸</span> is taken as the outline of a roof, while <span class="kanji-inline">至</span> depicts an inverted arrow and the spot where a shot arrow comes to rest. In ancient practice, the site for a temporary mortuary house was chosen by divination with sacred arrows—the place where the arrow fell marked the ground to build on. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">屋</span> originally referred to a board-walled shelter where a coffin was set out before the actual burial in a &quot;double funeral&quot; custom; from this it broadened to mean a house or residence, and by extension a shop.</p>
