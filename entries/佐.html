    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">佐</span> as a phono-semantic character built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="左.html">左</a> as its sound element. In the old form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="左.html">左</a> shows the left hand holding a ritual curse implement, used to seek out the presence of the deities and appeal for their help; from this it carried the sense of aiding or assisting. To apply that meaning to human affairs, the person classifier was added to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="左.html">左</a> to make <span class="kanji-inline">佐</span>, shifting the focus from divine matters to support among people. Accordingly, <span class="kanji-inline">佐</span> came to mean assistance and is often seen in official titles and posts, as in hosa (assistant).</p>
