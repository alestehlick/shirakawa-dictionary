    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">且</span> as a pictograph of a sacrificial board. Its fuller figure appears in <span class="kanji-inline">俎</span>, showing a chopping board with pieces of meat laid upon it. In early script two <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夕.html">夕</a>—used as an abbreviated form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肉.html">肉</a>, “meat”—are set on this board to depict an offering performed in the ancestral mausoleum where the spirits are kept. From this ritual context, <span class="kanji-inline">且</span> could even denote the ancestors themselves in antiquity. As the character drifted from its ceremonial roots, it came to be used adverbially for “and/also,” and by extension gained senses such as “for a short while” and “just about to.”</p>
