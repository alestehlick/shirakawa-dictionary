    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character was originally written <span class="kanji-inline">緜</span>, combining <span class="kanji-inline">帛</span> (silk cloth) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="系.html">系</a> (thread) to evoke the soft floss drawn from silk. The Setsumon gloss, “running in a line over a short span,” captures the image of fibers being spun and joined into a continuous thread; hence the word’s association with cotton-like floss and, by extension, with continuity, as in <span class="kanji-inline">綿</span><span class="kanji-inline">綿</span> “lasting on and on.” In antiquity it referred to silk floss; raw cotton was a later import from the south. Relatedly, <span class="kanji-inline">棉</span>, formed with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">帛</span>, specifically names cotton and the cotton plant.</p>
