    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">參</span>, the character combines the image of hair gathered at the crown with three ornamental hairpins and a kneeling figure below. The upper part shows the three pins set into the chignon, while the added <span class="kanji-inline">彡</span> evokes the gleam of their beaded tips; below is a person seen from the side in a posture of worship. From the three hairpins it could mean “three,” from the unequal lengths of the pins it suggested unevenness, and from the gathered hair it developed the sense of assembling or joining—hence uses such as <span class="kanji-inline">参</span><span class="kanji-inline">詣</span> for visiting a shrine and <span class="kanji-inline">参</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="差.html">差</a> for irregularity. Because the simple numeral <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="三.html">三</a> is easy to tamper with by adding strokes, <span class="kanji-inline">参</span> came to be used in its place in writing to prevent alteration.</p>
