    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">遞</span>, this is a picto-phonetic character. The phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">虒</span>, an image of a tiger’s hide being torn, conveys ideas of stripping away and alternation, which pair with the movement element to express things replacing one another in sequence. Hence the core sense of acting by turns, relieving or substituting in succession—aptly echoed in the Lüshi Chunqiu’s line about states “rising and falling alternately.” From this notion of successive change the character extended to sending something on in relay, as in <span class="kanji-inline">逓</span><span class="kanji-inline">信</span> (conveyance, post), and to uses like <span class="kanji-inline">逓</span><span class="kanji-inline">減</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">逓</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="増.html">増</a> for stepwise decrease and increase.</p>
