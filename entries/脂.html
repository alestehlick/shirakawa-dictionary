    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a>, the meat/flesh element, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="旨.html">旨</a> as the phonetic. Shirakawa explains <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="旨.html">旨</a> as a graph depicting a small meat knife cutting within a vessel, and by extension meaning “tasty, delicious.” Set beside the flesh radical, the character evokes richly flavored meat; since what makes meat delicious is its fat, the sense narrowed to “fat.” Thus <span class="kanji-inline">脂</span> names the fat within the flesh. In compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">脂</span><span class="kanji-inline">膏</span>, the term as a whole refers to animal fats, with <span class="kanji-inline">脂</span> indicating the fat marbled in the meat and <span class="kanji-inline">膏</span> denoting the fat of the internal organs.</p>
