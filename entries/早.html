    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa takes <span class="kanji-inline">早</span> as a loan graph whose original shape depicts the bowl of a spoon—the part used to scoop or scrape things up. When a handle is added, this base form yields the full character for spoon (<span class="kanji-inline">匙</span>). Because <span class="kanji-inline">早</span> shows that scooping, scraping tip, it alternates with <span class="kanji-inline">蚤</span> in early texts; Mencius, for example, writes <span class="kanji-inline">蚤</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="起.html">起</a> for rise early. Although <span class="kanji-inline">早</span> is not used with the literal sense spoon, its sound was borrowed, and the character came to write ideas such as early, morning, and young.</p>
