    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">迎</span> is a phono‑semantic compound. The phonetic is <span class="kanji-inline">卬</span>, a figure of two sides facing one another; when seen from below this facing form yields <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="仰.html">仰</a> “to look up,” and when seen from above it becomes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="抑.html">抑</a> “to press down.” With <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span>, the sign of going along a road, added, the sense focuses on going out to meet—welcoming someone who approaches from the opposite side. A related formation is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="逆.html">逆</a>, which shows a person viewed from the opposing side and, with <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span>, likewise evokes confronting someone coming toward you, though in usage it developed the meaning of going against or the direct opposite.</p>
