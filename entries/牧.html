    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">牧</span> is a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">牛</span>, “cattle,” and <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>, the hand holding a twig or switch, which came to mean striking or urging on. The character evokes driving cattle with a light switch out to graze, and by extension means to tend or raise livestock. It is not limited to cattle: horses, sheep, and similar herd animals are included. From the act of herding it further extends to the place where such animals are pastured, as seen in <span class="kanji-inline">牧</span><span class="kanji-inline">場</span>, ‘pasture’ (makiba, bokujo), and <span class="kanji-inline">牧</span> as ‘pasturage’ (maki).</p>
