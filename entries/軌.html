    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="車.html">車</a> element evokes a vehicle and its wheels, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="九.html">九</a> serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on reading ki—just as in <span class="kanji-inline">宄</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">馗</span>, which share this phonetic. Originally, <span class="kanji-inline">軌</span> denoted the spacing between the two wheels under a carriage—the wheel gauge—which anciently was fixed at six shaku and six sun. From this concrete sense of a set track, the character naturally came to mean a rule, standard, or model, hence its use in words that speak of norms and patterns.</p>
