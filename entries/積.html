    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="責.html">責</a> serves as the phonetic, pointing to the reading seki, and in its older form depicts a levy—valuables (shells) gathered as tribute and marked with a post or bundle (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="束.html">束</a>)—that is, property exacted as tax. The semantic <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span> is the rice plant, standing for grain. Together they first named agricultural goods taken in as tribute; from the image of such goods amassed in quantity, the character naturally came to mean to pile up, heap, stack, and to store or reserve.</p>
