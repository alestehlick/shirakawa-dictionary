    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="失.html">失</a> as its sound element. Shirakawa sees <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="失.html">失</a> as the figure of a shamanic attendant, hands and feet lifted in dance, absorbed in an ecstatic state that forgets the self. In <span class="kanji-inline">迭</span>, that dancer’s vigorous, up-and-down movement gives rise to the idea of things happening by turns and in reciprocity—hence meanings like “alternately,” “in turn,” and “mutually.” The same phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="失.html">失</a> appears in sibling characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">跌</span> (“to stumble”), marking the shared sound while the movement component in <span class="kanji-inline">迭</span> focuses the sense on repeated, alternating motion.</p>
