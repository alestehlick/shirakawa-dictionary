    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">偏</span> is a phono-semantic character: the person element <span class="kanji-inline">亻</span> combines with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">扁</span> (hen). <span class="kanji-inline">扁</span> originally depicts a braided single-leaf swing door, evoking the idea of a single side or ‘one,’ which lends the character its core sense of leaning to one side, being partial, and—when used adverbially—‘wholly, solely.’ Already in the Shuowen it is glossed as ‘to incline; one-sided,’ and it is used for senses such as ‘to lean,’ ‘one,’ ‘one side,’ and ‘earnestly/solely.’ The nuance appears in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">偏</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="枯.html">枯</a> (henko), meaning lateral paralysis, and tradition tells that Yu, the flood-controlling sage, became half paralyzed from his ceaseless labors.</p>
