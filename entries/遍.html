    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">遍</span> is a phono-semantic character whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">遍</span>. The element <span class="kanji-inline">扁</span> (hen), which depicts a braided single-leaf swinging door, provides the phonetic value and carries senses like “one side” or “incline.” When combined with motion components—<span class="kanji-inline">彳</span> or <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span>, both meaning “to walk, to go”—the graph comes to express movement spreading in every direction, hence “all over, everywhere.” The Shuowen records the older form <span class="kanji-inline">徧</span> and glosses it as “to go around, encircle,” reflecting this same wide-ranging motion. In Japan the character is familiar in <span class="kanji-inline">遍</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="路.html">路</a> (henro), the pilgrimage that makes the rounds of the eighty-eight sacred sites associated with Kūkai.</p>
