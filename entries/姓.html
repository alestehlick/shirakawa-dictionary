    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a> supplies the semantic ground of kinship—originally suggesting groups traced through the maternal line—while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="生.html">生</a>, the picture of a sprouting plant, provides the sound sei and the idea of birth. <span class="kanji-inline">姓</span> thus names those “born of the same blood,” a lineage or kin group. As such blood ties broadened, they formed larger associations that shared a common surname. In Zhou times, for example, the royal house bore the <span class="kanji-inline">姬</span> (Ji) surname. Shirakawa also distinguishes <span class="kanji-inline">姓</span> from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="氏.html">氏</a>: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="氏.html">氏</a> depicts the knife used to carve sacrificial meat and denotes those who participate together in the communal rituals and feasts after ancestor worship, whereas <span class="kanji-inline">姓</span> marks a group united by descent from the same ancestors. This sense of <span class="kanji-inline">姓</span> is not the same as the ancient Japanese kabane system.</p>
