    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the right side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="票.html">票</a> supplies the on reading hyo and evokes the idea of a slip or ticket, while the person radical on the left points to people as recipients. Early lexica such as the Yu Pian gloss it as “to scatter and distribute,” the act of handing things out to people, and even as a slip entitling one to alms. In Japanese the graph came to denote a straw sack or bale (tawara), a sense still felt in words like ippyō (one bale), dohyō (the sumo ring edged with straw bales), and komedawara (a straw sack of rice).</p>
