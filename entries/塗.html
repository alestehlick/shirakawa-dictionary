    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">涂</span>, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a> as the phonetic indicating the on reading to; in the later form <span class="kanji-inline">塗</span>, the earth element underscores the sense of mud and plaster. In Mencius’ phrase <span class="kanji-inline">坐</span><span class="kanji-inline">於</span><span class="kanji-inline">塗</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="炭.html">炭</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">塗</span> is glossed as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="泥.html">泥</a>, “mud.” From the core act of spreading wet material, the character came to mean to paint or plaster, and by extension also the road or way, as in <span class="kanji-inline">塗</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="説.html">説</a>. Plastering over—<span class="kanji-inline">塗</span>りこめる—was practiced as a ritual sealing to ward off malign forces, and <span class="kanji-inline">塗</span><span class="kanji-inline">殯</span> refers to coating the coffin with mud during the period of lying in state before burial. The character thus gathers the ideas of coating, mud, and the paths formed or muddied by it.</p>
