    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph formed from the grass sign <span class="kanji-inline">艸</span> above <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a>, “field.” In early lexica it is explained as plants growing on a field, and more specifically the young shoots of crops that have been set out in the paddies. From this concrete image it broadened to mean seedlings of all kinds. By extension it could also point to the far end of a lineage, as seen in the term <span class="kanji-inline">苗</span><span class="kanji-inline">裔</span> for distant descendants. The character further appears as the name of the southern Miao people, known in antiquity for their bronze drums; oracle-bone inscriptions record them, together with the Qiang, in the context of state ritual observances.</p>
