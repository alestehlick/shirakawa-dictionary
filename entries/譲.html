    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">讓</span>, this is a phono‑semantic character pairing <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> “words” with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">襄</span>. Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">襄</span> as the image of a corpse’s collar adorned with two ritual containers (sai) and four ‘curse tools’ set there to ward off invading spirits, so it carries the sense of exorcising, purifying, and of urging or reproaching. With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, the graph points to forceful, purifying words used to drive away malign forces. Related characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">攘</span> and the compound <span class="kanji-inline">攘</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斥.html">斥</a> speak of purifying and repelling, while <span class="kanji-inline">禳</span> denotes apotropaic purification; in ancient China a rite called <span class="kanji-inline">磔</span><span class="kanji-inline">禳</span> hung a dog’s skin at a fortress gate to avert harm, akin to Japan’s oniyarai. From this core idea of driving back and yielding ground, the meaning broadened to “hand over,” “cede,” and, by extension, “be modest.”</p>
