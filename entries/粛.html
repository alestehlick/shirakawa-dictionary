    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">肅</span>, this graph combines <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span>, a writing brush, with the ancient pictograph for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="規.html">規</a>, the compass used to draw circles. It evokes the act of first laying down a precise outline with a compass and then completing it with the brush by adding fine decorative patterns. Related characters illustrate the same idea of patterned adornment: <span class="kanji-inline">畫</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="画.html">画</a>) shows ornamenting a square shield, and <span class="kanji-inline">繡</span> refers to embroidery, fabric enriched with minute designs. In ritual contexts such careful decoration served to sanctify an object, and from that sense the character came to express restrained, respectful conduct and, by extension, the disciplined rectification reflected in later usages.</p>
