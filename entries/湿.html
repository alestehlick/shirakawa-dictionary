    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">濕</span>, the character combines the water element with a graph for ken: festoons of thread hung beneath a numinous jade, a ritual implement used to invite the gods and call forth their epiphany. This sense of divine manifestation resonates with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="顕.html">顕</a>, which depicts worship and the appearing of a deity. Closely related is <span class="kanji-inline">隰</span>, the sacred lowland where invocations are held—a place of descent and ascent for the divine. From naming the holy waterside where such rites were conducted, <span class="kanji-inline">湿</span> naturally developed the everyday meanings “to be damp” and “to moisten.”</p>
