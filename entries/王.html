    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">王</span> as a pictograph of a large broadax head. The fully equipped broadax with its handle is written <span class="kanji-inline">戊</span> (etsu, “broadax”). In ritual, the ax-head—its blade turned downward—was set before the ruler’s jade seat, not as a weapon but as a ceremonial emblem proclaiming royal authority. From this emblem the character came to mean lord and ruler. By contrast, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a> shows a smaller ax-head placed in the same downward posture, marking the rank of the warrior class; the difference between <span class="kanji-inline">王</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a> lies in the size of the broadax depicted.</p>
