    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: its base graph shows a bird being seized by two hands—an image of catching—that serves as the phonetic element and gives the on reading kaku. When the rice-plant sign <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span> is combined with this “seize-a-bird” base, the sense shifts to cutting and gathering grain, hence reap and harvest. A parallel formation replaces <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span> with the dog <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a> to make <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="獲.html">獲</a>, the act of taking game in the hunt. Within this family of graphs, <span class="kanji-inline">穫</span> is the later character, specialized for the harvest.</p>
