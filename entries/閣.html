    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">閣</span> is a phono-semantic compound: the gate frame (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a>) encloses <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="各.html">各</a>, which supplies the on reading kaku and also carries the sense of winding around, obstructing, and stopping. The character originally evoked a gate with posts set on both sides and a horizontal bar laid across to block passage. From this concrete image of barring a gateway, the meaning broadened to grand architectural structures associated with gates and frontage—stately pavilions and mansions (as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="楼.html">楼</a><span class="kanji-inline">閣</span>)—and, by extension, to a cabinet, as well as to items like a shelf or rack.</p>
