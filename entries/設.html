    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, “words, declarations,” and <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>, which in early form depicts a feathered ritual implement. Early glosses take it as “to provide and set in line,” originally referring to laying out ritual vessels. Although not attested in oracle-bone or bronze inscriptions, the components point to a scene in which words of oath (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>) are ritually purified and ordered with the feathered emblem (<span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>) before the gods. From this solemn act of arranging and presenting, the character broadened to the general senses of setting up, providing, arranging, and placing.</p>
