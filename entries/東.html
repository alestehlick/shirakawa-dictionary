    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains that the earliest form of <span class="kanji-inline">東</span> depicts a sack tied at the top and bottom. That figure, however, was pressed into service not for its original sense but as a phonetic loan to write the direction “east,” at a time when the script lacked native graphs for east, west, and south. To express the meaning “bag” explicitly, scribes later created the phono-semantic <span class="kanji-inline">橐</span> (“taku”) by adding the sound-marking element <span class="kanji-inline">石</span>—an on-reading marker also seen in <span class="kanji-inline">宕</span> (to) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="拓.html">拓</a> (taku). The portion of <span class="kanji-inline">橐</span> without <span class="kanji-inline">石</span> corresponds to the old shape of <span class="kanji-inline">東</span>. In Japanese the character also reads azuma, as in <span class="kanji-inline">東</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="歌.html">歌</a> (azumauta).</p>
