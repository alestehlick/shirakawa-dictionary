    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound that brings together <span class="kanji-inline">爪</span>, the fingers of a hand, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="孔.html">孔</a>, a child shown with the back of the head shaved. In <span class="kanji-inline">乳</span> a hand is set to the child&#x27;s head, vividly evoking the act of putting an infant to the breast, much like the graph used in the word for suckling (<span class="kanji-inline">授</span><span class="kanji-inline">乳</span>). Oracle-bone forms already portray a baby being nursed. From this concrete image arise the meanings of milk and the breast, and by extension the ideas of rearing and nourishing, including the milk of animals, as in cow&#x27;s milk.</p>
