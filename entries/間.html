    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">閒</span>, this character is a compound of a gate (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a>) with what looks like the moon (<span class="kanji-inline">月</span>) but in early forms is actually the flesh radical (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肉.html">肉</a>) set above it. Bronze inscriptions even show the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="外.html">外</a> written within the gate. Together these elements depict a rite performed at the gate of an ancestral mausoleum, where meat was offered in prayer—a scene centered on the threshold that separates outside from inside. From this image of a dividing boundary arose the senses of an interval or stretch of time and space (aida, ma), a gap or opening, and, by extension, a state of calm or quiet.</p>
