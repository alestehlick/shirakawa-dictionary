    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">閉</span> as a compound of the gate <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a>, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a> understood not as “talent” but as a post-like landmark tree set up as a sign. Erected at a gateway, this post becomes a ritual barrier that wards off evil, sealing the threshold and marking the boundary between inside and outside. From this protective act arises the meanings “to shut in,” “to close,” and “to stop up” a door. In the compound <span class="kanji-inline">閉</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>, the sense is literally that of closing the mouth—falling silent—which in Japanese usage came to suggest being talked down or left speechless in surrender.</p>
