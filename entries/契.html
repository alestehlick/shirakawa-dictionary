    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">契</span> as a compound that marries the idea of cutting a notch with the front-view figure of a person (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>), conjuring the act of incising a solemn mark. In early usage it suggests carving a sign with a knife—even upon the forehead—to fix status. The practice then moved to wood or bamboo: notches were cut to record an agreement, and the piece was split lengthwise into two matching halves that could be rejoined later as proof, hence the sense of a tally and, by extension, pledging and covenanting. From this core comes the meaning “to engrave” as the physical act that seals the promise, and “to pledge” as the social act it guarantees. In compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">契</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="約.html">約</a>, the pledge (<span class="kanji-inline">契</span>) is paired with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="約.html">約</a> “to bind,” and weighty covenants were also commemorated by inscriptions on ritual tripods (<span class="kanji-inline">鼎</span>), underscoring the character’s association with formal, binding agreements.</p>
