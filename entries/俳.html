    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">俳</span> is a phono-semantic character formed with the person radical and <span class="kanji-inline">非</span> as the sound sign. Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">非</span> as the figure of a fine‑toothed comb, its teeth notched symmetrically on both sides; in characters such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="排.html">排</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">徘</span> it serves chiefly to mark the on-reading hai. The Shuowen already glosses <span class="kanji-inline">俳</span> as “to play, sport,” and Shirakawa takes the graph to evoke two people set side by side in playful performance. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">俳</span> came to mean jesting, clowning, and comic acting—hence <span class="kanji-inline">俳</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="優.html">優</a>, “actor.” In verse, the playful haikai tradition led to <span class="kanji-inline">俳</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="句.html">句</a>, the independent opening verse that crystallized into a seventeen-syllable 5–7–5 poem.</p>
