    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">客</span> is a compound character formed from <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="各.html">各</a>. The<span class="kanji-inline">宀</span> component depicts a great roof, the mitamaya—a mausoleum where ancestors are enshrined. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="各.html">各</a> shows the act of presenting a sai, a ritual container that holds written prayers, and making supplication as the deities descend in response to the invitation. Together they portray a deity who comes down and enters the ancestral shrine: a god called in from outside, the “guest god” (kyakujin), known in Japan as maroudo, a deity of another clan. Over time the sacred sense broadened to human visitors, yielding meanings such as guest, customer, and traveler.</p>
