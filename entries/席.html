    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its old form, <span class="kanji-inline">席</span> combines the profile of a building (<span class="kanji-inline">厂</span>) with the straw mat (<span class="kanji-inline">蓆</span>). A mat spread out within a building marks a person’s place, giving the senses of a mat and a seat, and by extension the act of laying something out. Shirakawa distinguishes <span class="kanji-inline">筵</span> as the mat laid directly on bare ground, while <span class="kanji-inline">席</span> is the additional covering placed on top. In formal etiquette, people seated before elders kept a distance of one jō (about 3.03 m) between mats; from this, kanjō (“inserting a jō”) later came to refer to the courteous side addition to an address in a letter. Because mats are rolled up and stored, compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">席</span><span class="kanji-inline">捲</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">席</span><span class="kanji-inline">巻</span> evoke sweeping across and taking possession, as if rolling up a mat.</p>
