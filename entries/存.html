    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">存</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">才</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">子</span>. <span class="kanji-inline">才</span> depicts the crosspiece fixed atop a landmark tree raised as a sacred signpost; in ancient rites a covenant receptacle for petitions to the gods was attached to such a pole, a prototype that also underlies <span class="kanji-inline">在</span>. Adding <span class="kanji-inline">士</span>—the head of a small broadax used as a sacred implement—to <span class="kanji-inline">才</span> yields <span class="kanji-inline">在</span>, affirming a place as sanctified and truly present. In <span class="kanji-inline">存</span>, by contrast, <span class="kanji-inline">子</span> is joined to <span class="kanji-inline">才</span>, picturing a child placed under that consecrating sign. It conveys a child being hallowed so that his life is preserved, and from this it comes to mean to be, to exist in a consecrated state, to live, and to keep. By extension it also covers inner intention and regard, as in <span class="kanji-inline">存</span><span class="kanji-inline">心</span> (thought held in the heart) and <span class="kanji-inline">存</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="問.html">問</a> (inquiring after someone’s condition). Even <span class="kanji-inline">存</span><span class="kanji-inline">在</span> originally suggested presence established through sanctification and purification, not mere factual existence.</p>
