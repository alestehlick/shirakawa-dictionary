    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">存</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a>. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a> depicts the crosspiece fixed atop a landmark tree raised as a sacred signpost; in ancient rites a covenant receptacle for petitions to the gods was attached to such a pole, a prototype that also underlies <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="在.html">在</a>. Adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a>—the head of a small broadax used as a sacred implement—to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a> yields <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="在.html">在</a>, affirming a place as sanctified and truly present. In <span class="kanji-inline">存</span>, by contrast, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a> is joined to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a>, picturing a child placed under that consecrating sign. It conveys a child being hallowed so that his life is preserved, and from this it comes to mean to be, to exist in a consecrated state, to live, and to keep. By extension it also covers inner intention and regard, as in <span class="kanji-inline">存</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a> (thought held in the heart) and <span class="kanji-inline">存</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="問.html">問</a> (inquiring after someone’s condition). Even <span class="kanji-inline">存</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="在.html">在</a> originally suggested presence established through sanctification and purification, not mere factual existence.</p>
