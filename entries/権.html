    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">權</span>, this is a phono-semantic character with the phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">雚</span> (kan), the name of the sacred stork (<span class="kanji-inline">鸛</span>) used in bird divination. From that divinatory background arises the sense of gauging or estimating, and by extension acting provisionally and in response to circumstances—hence its use in titles meaning acting or temporary (gon). From the idea of responding to the situation comes the notion of exercising controlling influence, giving the meanings power and authority seen in compounds like kenryoku and kensei. The character also bears a concrete sense of balance and counterweight, which underlies the meanings scale and weight.</p>
