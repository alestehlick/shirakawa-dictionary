    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the metal element signals something made of metal, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="充.html">充</a> provides the sound. Shirakawa notes that <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="充.html">充</a> originally depicted a person with a distended belly, and by extension came to name a round socket-like hole; the Yu Pian glosses it as the hole into which an axe handle is fitted. When firearms were later devised, the character was applied to them, likely by analogy with the circular opening of the muzzle. In usage, <span class="kanji-inline">銃</span> came to denote small firearms, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="砲.html">砲</a> referred to heavy pieces.</p>
