    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form is <span class="kanji-inline">竝</span>, made by placing two instances of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="立.html">立</a> side by side. Since <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="立.html">立</a> depicts a person standing as seen from the front, <span class="kanji-inline">竝</span> shows two people standing left and right in a row, which naturally gives the sense of “to line up,” “to form a line,” and, by extension, “and,” “together,” and “all.” In Japanese it also carries the everyday sense of nami, “average” or “ordinary,” as in expressions like hitonami and sekkennami, and appears in words such as namiki, “a row of trees.” A related form shows the pair aligned front to back, and this became the original graph for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="併.html">併</a>; that form is sometimes used in its place.</p>
