    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the earliest script forms, <span class="kanji-inline">章</span> is a pictograph: the upper part shows the tattooing needle (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辛.html">辛</a>), while the lower element depicts the pooled, saturated ink (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>). From this image it conveyed the vivid, conspicuous beauty of ornamented skin—an idea echoed in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="彰.html">彰</a>, and paired with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="文.html">文</a>, the figure of patterned body design, which together gave rise to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="文.html">文</a><span class="kanji-inline">章</span> as “beautifully patterned design.” Because tattoos in ancient society also served for rites of passage and to indicate social rank, the character broadened to mean a model, a rule, and a distinguishing emblem or sign. By extension, it came to mark the divisions of poetry and music, and ultimately the modern sense of a “chapter.”</p>
