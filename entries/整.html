    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">整</span> as a phono-semantic compound. It combines <span class="kanji-inline">敕</span> (later written <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勅.html">勅</a>), which evoked the act of striking and bundling brushwood to make it uniform, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="正.html">正</a>, “to make correct.” Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="正.html">正</a> also provides the on-reading sei, making it an ekisei, a co-phonetic in which the phonetic element carries meaning as well. From this imagery the original sense is to set what is uneven or irregular into order; over time it broadened to mean arranging and correcting what is out of line, bringing things into a proper, orderly state.</p>
