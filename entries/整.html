    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: the component <span class="kanji-inline">敕</span> (also written <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勅.html">勅</a>) depicts beating a bundle of brushwood into orderly alignment, expressing the act of straightening and arranging. The element <span class="kanji-inline">正</span> supplies the sound sei and also contributes its sense of “to make correct,” functioning as a co-phonetic that bears meaning as well as sound. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">整</span> originally meant to set what is uneven or irregular in order, and by extension came to mean to arrange, to correct, and to bring things into a proper state.</p>
