    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A picto-phonetic character formed with the water element and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="登.html">登</a> as the phonetic, which signals the On reading cho. The earliest form is written as <span class="kanji-inline">澂</span>, glossed in the Shuowen as “to be clear,” first referring to water settling and becoming limpid. From the image of clarified water, the sense naturally broadened to clarity of mind and the like, yielding the verbal uses sumu (to grow clear) and sumasu (to make clear, to clarify). In Hàn-period epitaphs the form <span class="kanji-inline">澄</span> is consistently used, and this became the standard character.</p>
