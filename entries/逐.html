    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">逐</span> as a compound built on the movement element <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span>, with the earliest forms showing a dog <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a> following the track marks <span class="kanji-inline">之</span>, a pictograph of footprints. The image is of a dog setting off after a trail, which naturally yields the core sense “to pursue, to chase,” and by extension “to follow” and “to drive out.” From the notion of going after something in sequence, the word also comes to be used for competing and running. Relatedly, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="追.html">追</a> is used when speaking of sending out forces to pursue an enemy.</p>
