    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">漆</span> is a phono-semantic character. Its inner element carries the on reading shitsu and, in the oldest forms, depicts lacquer sap running from a cut in a tree’s bark—the original graph for lacquer. Because it signifies a liquid, the water element was added, yielding the current form with the sense of liquid lacquer and moistening. As lacquer is applied with a brush, there is also a related form that combines the idea of lacquer with the image of brush hairs, used for the verb “to lacquer.” Lacquer is a distinctive product of East Asia: inventories from the Zhou period already list vermilion-lacquered bows and arrows (<span class="kanji-inline">彤</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="弓.html">弓</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">彤</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="矢.html">矢</a>) as well as black-lacquered ceremonial sets, and Han-era archaeological finds frequently include lacquerware.</p>
