    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">看</span> brings together the hand and the eye—the hand lifted to shade the eyes so one can look out into the distance. From this image it took on the basic sense of looking and watching, with a special nuance of gazing far and keeping a steady, intent lookout. Shirakawa groups it among the many characters that express different ways of ‘miru’ (to see), and here the focus is on screening glare to see clearly, a fixed, penetrating look that can even suggest seeing through to the essence of things. In extended use it naturally shades into the idea of watching over and attending to someone.</p>
