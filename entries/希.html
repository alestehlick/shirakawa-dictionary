    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a loosely woven cloth. The upper element, <span class="kanji-inline">爻</span>, sketches the crisscross of the weave, while the lower <span class="kanji-inline">巾</span> shows the cloth itself, likely hemp. From the image of an open, sparse fabric it came to mean “rare, few.” In later usage that sense was often written with <span class="kanji-inline">稀</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">希</span>, by phonetic association with other ki-sounding graphs that express wanting, was adopted to write the idea of hoping or desiring.</p>
