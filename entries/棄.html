    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">棄</span> as a vivid compound depicting the abandonment of an infant. The character brings together the form of a newborn shown upside down, a woven basket, and the two hands set side by side, presenting the scene of placing a baby in a basket and pushing it away with both hands. From this concrete image the sense “to throw away, abandon” arises. He notes that in antiquity there was a custom of setting the first child adrift to watch for omens before deciding to raise it, and recalls the legend of Hou Ji, ancestral figure of the Zhou, who was abandoned at birth and named Qi (<span class="kanji-inline">棄</span>), but taken back when an auspicious sign appeared.</p>
