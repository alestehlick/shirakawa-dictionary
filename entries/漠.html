    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with the water element and <span class="kanji-inline">莫</span> as the phonetic. <span class="kanji-inline">莫</span>, which gives the on reading baku, depicts the sun sinking into grasses and is also the source of the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="暮.html">暮</a>, “dusk.” In the Shuowen it is glossed as the northern “flowing sands,” evoking the Gobi and the image of a desolate expanse. From that scene arise the extended senses of quietness, forlornness, and boundless breadth, which underlie uses for vagueness or immense, continuing wilderness.</p>
