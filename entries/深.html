    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the water sign on the left combines with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">罙</span> (read shin). In the old forms, <span class="kanji-inline">罙</span> shows a torch lowered into a cavity, the image of lighting and searching within an enclosed chamber used in ancestral rites. With the hand radical, this same graph yields <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="探.html">探</a>, “to search,” the act of probing a hole by firelight; with water instead, it becomes <span class="kanji-inline">深</span>, evoking the notion of probing into water—hence “deep water.” From this concrete scene the meaning broadened to “deep, profound,” and by extension it came to be used for senses such as excelling, strictness, and the lateness of the hour.</p>
