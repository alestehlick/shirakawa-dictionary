    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">板</span> is a phono-semantic character: the wood element supplies the meaning, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="反.html">反</a> serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on reading han. Bronze inscriptions depict a hand wielding an axe against a tree, vividly expressing the act of chipping off a slab—hence the core sense of a thin board or plank. Although the Shuowen does not record <span class="kanji-inline">板</span>, the Yù Piān defines it as “a piece of wood, the same as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="版.html">版</a>,” implying that <span class="kanji-inline">板</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="版.html">版</a> were originally the same graph. In early usage they often substitute for one another, which is why the term for a woodblock used in printing can appear as either <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="版.html">版</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> or <span class="kanji-inline">板</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>.</p>
