    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">男</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a>, the cultivated field, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a>, which in early forms depicts a plow. The pairing vividly evokes the act of working the land—ploughing and cultivation—and originally pointed to the person who managed agricultural fields. From this base it generalized to mean a man, and in later usage it also served to write the lowest of the five noble ranks (<span class="kanji-inline">公</span>・<span class="kanji-inline">侯</span>・<span class="kanji-inline">伯</span>・<span class="kanji-inline">子</span>・<span class="kanji-inline">男</span>), the title now rendered as “baron” in <span class="kanji-inline">男</span><span class="kanji-inline">爵</span>. In classical poetry, the character <span class="kanji-inline">士</span> often appears for the upright “man” of the warrior class, standing alongside <span class="kanji-inline">男</span>’s agricultural and social nuances.</p>
