    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">冷</span> is a phono-semantic character: the “ice” element points to coldness, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="令.html">令</a> serves as the phonetic and provides the on reading rei. The ancient lexicon Shuowen defines its core sense simply as “cold,” the chill of kanrei, from which its uses spread naturally to states and actions—being cold, growing cold, and cooling or letting something cool. In Japanese it lives on in everyday words such as hie (a chill), hiya (chilled water or sake), and hiyakasu (to banter), preserving the idea of coolness both as sensation and as a figurative tone.</p>
