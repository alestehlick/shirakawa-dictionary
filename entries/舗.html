    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">甫</span> as its phonetic core, furnishing the on-reading ho. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">甫</span> originally depicts a young plant with its roots. In the Shuowen it appears as <span class="kanji-inline">鋪</span> and is explained as the metal fittings of a door or gate. In later usage the form <span class="kanji-inline">舗</span> came to express laying out or arranging in rows, hence its use in words such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="店.html">店</a><span class="kanji-inline">舗</span> (shop) and, by extension, the sense of laying or paving a surface, as in <span class="kanji-inline">舗</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="石.html">石</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">舗</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="装.html">装</a>.</p>
