    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">第</span> is a phono‑semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="竹.html">竹</a> shows the bamboo slips (chikukan) that served as writing materials, and an abbreviated form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="弟.html">弟</a> functions as the phonetic, indicating the On reading tei/dai. As the Shuowen explains, it originally evoked bamboo slips bound neatly in order with a leather thong (<span class="kanji-inline">韋</span>), hence the idea of arranging things in proper sequence. From this core meaning come its roles as an ordinal marker and as a word for ranking, as well as its use in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="及.html">及</a><span class="kanji-inline">第</span>, “to pass an examination.” By extension, the On reading tei was also employed as a substitute for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="邸.html">邸</a>, giving the sense “mansion” in certain contexts.</p>
