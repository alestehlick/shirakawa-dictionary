    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the step/road element signals movement along a path, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="盾.html">盾</a> provides the sound jun and evokes the image of raising a shield to tour and inspect, acts associated with pacifying and guiding people. Classical glossaries group it with related graphs—such as <span class="kanji-inline">遹</span>, which depicts a pike set up for patrol and coercive inspection, and <span class="kanji-inline">遵</span>, which shows circling with a ritual wine vessel to lead worship—placing it in a semantic field of going around and making others follow. From this background, <span class="kanji-inline">循</span> comes to mean to follow or be led/attended, and by extension to circulate, to make the rounds.</p>
