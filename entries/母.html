    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph of a woman’s torso with prominent breasts, and so first named the mother. From that core image it naturally came to denote a grandmother or a wet nurse, and by extension anything that serves as a root or source, like a mother who brings forth a child. In related graphs, <span class="kanji-inline">每</span> (later written <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="毎.html">毎</a>) shows a woman with her hair tied and set with a fixed ornament; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="敏.html">敏</a> adds the hand element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a> to that hairpiece, depicting the act of attentively arranging it—hence the sense of earnest, ritual effort.</p>
