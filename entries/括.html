    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the hand element signals a manual act, while the phonetic component belongs to the katsu group seen in graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">刮</span> and in the form explained under <span class="kanji-inline">昏</span>, where a small handled knife pierces a ritual “sai,” the vessel that held petitions to the gods, thereby cutting off their efficacy. From this image of cutting or effacing, <span class="kanji-inline">括</span> turns to the concrete deed performed by the hand: gathering what has been cut and tying it together into a single bundle. Hence its senses of binding, bundling, and by extension bringing things together as one—summarizing or including.</p>
