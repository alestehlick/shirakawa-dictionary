    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">兩</span> as a pictograph of the yoke (eku) used to harness draft animals. In chariot teams two horses were hitched abreast, and the graph sketches the connection of their yokes, an image that naturally yields the senses of “two,” “both,” and things set side by side. From this base comes <span class="kanji-inline">輛</span>, tied to vehicles in formation, while in <span class="kanji-inline">倆</span> the idea extends to the coordinated dexterity of the two hands.</p>
