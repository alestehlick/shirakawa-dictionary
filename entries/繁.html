    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="敏.html">敏</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a>. In early forms, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="敏.html">敏</a> shows a finely adorned woman with a hand reaching to her hairpieces, the act of arranging hair ornaments for sacred rites—a scene that conveys devoted, diligent attentiveness. By adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a>, the threads and cords of further ornamentation, the graph evokes luxuriant, abundant hair decorations. From this image of richly layered adornment, the sense extends to abundance and frequency: many, flourishing, growing dense and thick. In turn, the notion of things occurring often broadened to suggest matters becoming complicated or busy.</p>
