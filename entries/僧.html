    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the person radical indicates a person, while the right-side element <span class="kanji-inline">曾</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">曽</span>—written in older form as <span class="kanji-inline">會</span>—serves as the phonetic, marking the on-reading so. That older form <span class="kanji-inline">會</span> originally depicted a steamer basket (koshiki), earthenware in antiquity and later bamboo. The graph further reflects an abbreviated phonetic rendering of the Sanskrit saṅgha (<span class="kanji-inline">僧</span><span class="kanji-inline">伽</span>), and thus came to mean a person who practices the Buddha’s teaching—hence ‘Buddhist monk’ and ‘priest.’ It appears in usages such as sō and sōryo, and Buddhists were also referred to as futodōjin, taking the on-reading from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="仏.html">仏</a> (futsu).</p>
