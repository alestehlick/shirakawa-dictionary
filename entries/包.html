    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally a pictograph of a human embryo enclosed in the womb, <span class="kanji-inline">包</span> shows the outer curve <span class="kanji-inline">勹</span> as a person seen in side profile, bending protectively around the inner form. The inner element <span class="kanji-inline">巳</span> depicts the fetus itself, its upper part suggesting the head. In later standardized forms this inner shape came to resemble <span class="kanji-inline">己</span>, which obscured the fetal image. From the primary sense of being pregnant, the character naturally extended to mean wrapping, covering, and placing something within. Related graphs reinforce this imagery: <span class="kanji-inline">孕</span> shows a figure with a swollen belly in profile, and <span class="kanji-inline">身</span> likewise portrays the body of a pregnant woman.</p>
