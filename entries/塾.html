    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">孰</span> (juku) providing the sound, <span class="kanji-inline">塾</span> originally designated a wakibeya—an auxiliary room beside a building’s entrance. This side chamber was used for ceremonies such as coming-of-age rites and, by its quiet and set-apart nature, became a place for study. From this setting the graph took on the sense of a study room and then a place of learning. In Japan it came to name private academies, especially in the Edo period, and today commonly refers to cram schools alongside regular schools.</p>
