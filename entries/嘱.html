    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">嘱</span> as a phono-semantic character whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">囑</span>. The element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> signals speech, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="属.html">属</a> serves as the phonetic and also carries the sense of an ongoing attachment. He analyzes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="属.html">属</a> as a graph formed from parts representing a female and a male animal in mutual cohabitation, hence the idea of being linked and continuing together. With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="目.html">目</a> added, the related character <span class="kanji-inline">矚</span> means to keep one’s eyes fixed and attend closely; with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">嘱</span> turns that sustained attention into spoken direction—telling someone what to do so that it will be carried out. From this it comes to mean to charge or order a task and to entrust it (tanomu, yudaneru), with the On reading shoku.</p>
