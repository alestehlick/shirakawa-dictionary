    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">總</span>, this is a phono-semantic character. With the thread radical signaling strands, the graph depicts the ends of threads drawn together and tied into a tuft; early glosses also understood it as bundled hair. From this concrete image of binding and bundling arose the meanings “to collect, to bring together,” which further extended to “to oversee and unify,” as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">総</span><span class="kanji-inline">督</span>. In Japanese it also came to denote “all, the whole; total.” The on-reading sō follows the phonetic element.</p>
