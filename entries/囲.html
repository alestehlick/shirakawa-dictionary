    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">圍</span>: the outer <span class="kanji-inline">囗</span> is the city wall, and inside stands <span class="kanji-inline">韋</span>. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">韋</span> was formed from the footprint sign <span class="kanji-inline">止</span> arranged to show movement going around—right, left, above, and below—evoking the act of circling; as a phonetic it gives the on reading i and carries the sense of passing or going around (as in <span class="kanji-inline">違</span>). Set against the image of city walls, this circling can mean patrolling to protect (which yields <span class="kanji-inline">衛</span>, “to guard”) or investing an enemy by surrounding it (<span class="kanji-inline">圍</span>). Thus <span class="kanji-inline">囲</span> came to mean to enclose, surround, and encircle.</p>
