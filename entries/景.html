    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">景</span> is a phono-semantic character. Its phonetic is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="京.html">京</a>, the figure of an arched fortress gate topped by a watchtower, which provides the reading kei. The character conveys a state suffused with light, and from this core sense it comes to mean both light itself and, by extension, the shadow that light casts. Hence its use for scenery, a scene, and the outward look or aspect of things as they stand in the light. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions one even finds personal names written with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="京.html">京</a>, and the related character <span class="kanji-inline">影</span> names the image of something in shadow brought forth by light.</p>
