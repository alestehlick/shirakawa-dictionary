    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character was originally written <span class="kanji-inline">學</span>. In its earliest form it sketches a school building, recognizable by the crossed roof timbers (chigi). The graph combines the crossed marks <span class="kanji-inline">爻</span> with an element later written as <span class="kanji-inline">臼</span>, which Shirakawa takes as a pair of hands—the act of guiding and instructing. Set above the child <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a>, the composition becomes <span class="kanji-inline">學</span>, expressing the learning of the young. In antiquity, this evoked the rite in which youths, on coming of age, were taught the clan’s traditions and the norms of life under the elders’ supervision. The related <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="教.html">教</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">敎</span>) brings together <span class="kanji-inline">爻</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a> with <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>, the striking hand, to show “to teach,” and some old forms of <span class="kanji-inline">学</span> likewise added <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>.</p>
