    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the element for earth conveys the act of putting something into the ground, while a phonetic element supplies the mai/bai reading. In ancient ritual usage, <span class="kanji-inline">埋</span> referred specifically to burying sacrificial offerings in the earth. The Zhou Rites describe venerating mountains, forests, rivers, and marshes by burying or sinking offerings; here <span class="kanji-inline">埋</span> names the interment itself, read with the on-yomi bai in this ritual sense. Such burial was understood as protection against malevolent forces rising from underground, the feared gu. From that sacred context the meaning broadened to the general senses “to bury,” “to fill up,” and “to be buried.”</p>
