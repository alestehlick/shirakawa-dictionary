    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">畫</span>, the character combines <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span>, a writing brush, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a>, which in early script represents <span class="kanji-inline">周</span>—a square shield. <span class="kanji-inline">画</span> thus evokes the act of drawing or inscribing designs upon that shield, and by extension the picture or pattern itself. The <span class="kanji-inline">周</span> shield was a square divided by a cross and engraved with patterned fields; such shields, to which departing troops would attach a ritual sai vessel holding written prayers to the gods, served as objects of solemn vow. From the frequent depiction of these compartmented shield patterns arose the sense of marking off or partitioning (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="区.html">区</a><span class="kanji-inline">画</span>). Historically, <span class="kanji-inline">劃</span> was the character used specifically for “to divide/mark off,” while in usage <span class="kanji-inline">画</span> takes the on reading ga for the picture/drawing sense, and kaku for the senses of limiting, dividing, or measuring.</p>
