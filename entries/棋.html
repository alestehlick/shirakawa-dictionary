    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">棋</span> takes its sound from <span class="kanji-inline">其</span> (ki). The graph <span class="kanji-inline">其</span> originally represents a <span class="kanji-inline">箕</span>, a square, dustpan-like implement, and by extension suggests something nearly square. Because the go and shogi boards are square, <span class="kanji-inline">其</span> was employed in characters used for these games, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="碁.html">碁</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">棋</span>. In antiquity such games were known by names like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="博.html">博</a><span class="kanji-inline">棋</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="六.html">六</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="博.html">博</a>, and <span class="kanji-inline">弈</span><span class="kanji-inline">棋</span>. A third-century work known as the Entertainment Classic describes a board seventeen lines by seventeen with one hundred fifty black and white pieces, essentially the game of go as we recognize it today. The game was transmitted to Japan with the Tang diplomatic missions.</p>
