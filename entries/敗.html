    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">敗</span> is a compound character. The element <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span> shows a hand wielding a stick to strike, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a> depicts the prized cowry shells that once served as treasure and currency. The image is of striking what is valuable, yielding senses such as to break, damage, or ruin, and by extension to be defeated, as in words like <span class="kanji-inline">敗</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戦.html">戦</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">敗</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="北.html">北</a>. In the oldest tortoise-shell and bone inscriptions, the graph appears with <span class="kanji-inline">鼎</span> (a ritual cauldron) alongside <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>, evoking the act of defacing covenant texts engraved on a ding. To mar that sacred inscription is to break the pact—a symbolic undoing that naturally broadened into the notions of loss and defeat.</p>
