    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa identifies the original form of this word as <span class="kanji-inline">愒</span>, a phono-semantic character in which <span class="kanji-inline">曷</span> serves as the phonetic element that signals the on-reading kei, while the sense centers on breathing and repose. The Shuowen glosses <span class="kanji-inline">愒</span> as “to breathe,” from which the meaning “to rest” naturally follows; the Er Ya similarly defines <span class="kanji-inline">憩</span> as “to breathe,” showing that <span class="kanji-inline">愒</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">憩</span> share the same core idea. The later, commonly used graph <span class="kanji-inline">憩</span> writes this meaning more pictorially by combining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="息.html">息</a> “breath” and <span class="kanji-inline">舌</span> “tongue,” evoking a pause to catch one’s breath, and it functions as the popular counterpart to the older <span class="kanji-inline">愒</span>.</p>
