    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">悟</span> is a phono-semantic character: the heart/mind element combines with <span class="kanji-inline">吾</span>, which here is not the pronoun but the name of a ritual receptacle (sai) used to store written prayers to the deities. This vessel was sealed with a double wooden lid to preserve the efficacy of the prayers, a feature that the bronze forms emphasize through the strongly drawn double cover. As a phonetic, <span class="kanji-inline">吾</span> supplies the on reading go; as an image, it suggests preservation. In <span class="kanji-inline">悟</span> this preservation becomes the mind’s power to drive away delusion or spiritual darkness, so that one clearly apprehends the principles of things. Hence its sense of “awakening” or “realizing,” matching the Shuowen gloss of <span class="kanji-inline">覺</span>, “to awaken.”</p>
