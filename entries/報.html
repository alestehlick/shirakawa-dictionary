    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">報</span> is a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幸.html">幸</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">艮</span>. In ancient graphs, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幸.html">幸</a> depicts the wooden restraints placed on the hands, while <span class="kanji-inline">艮</span> shows a kneeling person held down by a hand—an image that also underlies the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="服.html">服</a> of submission. Together they portray a culprit restrained from behind, so the earliest sense was to take countermeasures against a wrong—retaliation. In bronze inscriptions, however, the character is already used in the realm of reciprocity: favor, and the acts of giving back—rewarding, answering, making a return. From this notion of responding and returning, the meaning broadened to the social act of conveying news, hence later uses such as <span class="kanji-inline">報</span><span class="kanji-inline">告</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">報</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="知.html">知</a> for reporting and informing.</p>
