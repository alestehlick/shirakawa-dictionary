    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">移</span> as a compound: <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span>, the grain plant, joined with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="多.html">多</a>, which depicts heaps of meat—its repeated <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> functioning as an archaic form for meat. The graph evokes an exorcistic offering, where abundant grain and meat were presented to the spirits so that misfortune might be transferred elsewhere. This ritual notion of diverting calamity survives in the Zuozhuan phrase <span class="kanji-inline">移</span><span class="kanji-inline">殃</span>, in which disaster is shifted from the ruler to his retainers. From this original sense of transferring ill fortune, the character broadened to mean to move, shift, or change.</p>
