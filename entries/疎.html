    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a phono-semantic graph whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">疏</span>. In that earlier graph, <span class="kanji-inline">疋</span> serves as the sound-bearing element (sho/so) and also hints at the idea of “passing through,” while a crosshatched component like <span class="kanji-inline">爻</span> suggests the rough weave of coarse cloth. From the image of something passing through a loose, open texture came the sense “to go through without hindrance,” seen in words such as <span class="kanji-inline">疏</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="通.html">通</a>, and by extension associations with coarseness or rusticity (as in <span class="kanji-inline">疏</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="野.html">野</a>). The popular form <span class="kanji-inline">疎</span> replaces the weaving element—at times with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="充.html">充</a>, as in <span class="kanji-inline">梳</span> “comb,” evoking the act of combing through—and it came to emphasize looseness of connection: sparsity, remoteness, and estrangement, as in <span class="kanji-inline">疎</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遠.html">遠</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">疎</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="略.html">略</a>, or <span class="kanji-inline">疎</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="布.html">布</a>. Thus the graph centers on the notion of looseness and things that pass easily through a rough or open mesh, yielding both the concrete image of coarse weave and the abstract senses of being thinly connected or far apart.</p>
