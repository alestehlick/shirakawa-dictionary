    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">鐵</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the metal radical marks it as a metal, while the element read as tetsu (here identified with <span class="kanji-inline">戴</span>) supplies the sound. The tradition also connects the graph with a sense of dark color—the word tetsu evokes the deep, reddish-black sheen likened to a black-chestnut horse. The Shuowen straightforwardly glosses it as kurogane, “iron.” From the nature of the substance itself, the character readily came to carry the associated ideas of hardness and strength.</p>
