    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">痘</span> takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="豆.html">豆</a> as its phonetic, giving the on-yomi to, and names a disease whose blisters were likened to peas. Hence terms such as <span class="kanji-inline">痘</span><span class="kanji-inline">瘡</span> (“smallpox sores”) and <span class="kanji-inline">疱</span><span class="kanji-inline">瘡</span> (“blister sores”). The illness is marked by high fever, the eruption of watery blisters, and the pockmarks they leave. It is a highly contagious viral disease that was long feared for its high mortality, officially classified among legally designated infectious diseases, yet controlled through <span class="kanji-inline">種</span><span class="kanji-inline">痘</span> (preventive inoculation) and now regarded as nearly eradicated.</p>
