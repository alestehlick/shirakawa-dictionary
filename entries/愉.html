    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">愉</span> is a phono-semantic character. Its right component <span class="kanji-inline">兪</span> (yu) supplies the sound and originally combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舟.html">舟</a> (a tub or plate) with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a> (a handled surgical knife), depicting the lancing of an abscess and the draining of pus and blood into a vessel—hence the idea of healing and recovery. With the heart element on the left, this notion of cure shifts into the realm of feeling: when sickness is healed, the heart is put at ease. From that state of ease arise senses such as to enjoy, to be glad, and to feel at peace. A kindred graph built on the same structure, <span class="kanji-inline">愈</span>, besides meaning to heal, also came to mean to surpass and ever more.</p>
