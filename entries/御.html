    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">御</span> as a phono-semantic graph. The character incorporates a phonetic element (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="卸.html">卸</a>), while its ancient forms depict a kneeling worshiper bowing in reverence before sacred objects—either a twisted bundle of threads (yō) or a mallet-like emblem (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="午.html">午</a>/<span class="kanji-inline">杵</span>). These ritual tokens were thought to welcome descending deities and, by their numinous presence, repel misfortune. From this ritual scene arises the basic senses of “to meet (the gods)” and “to ward off,” which naturally extend to “to serve” the deities and thus “to use” or “to employ.” In time, the character came to be prefixed to words connected with persons of high rank (as in <span class="kanji-inline">御</span><span class="kanji-inline">衣</span>, imperial clothing), imparting honor. Because its Sino-Japanese reading coincided with that of <span class="kanji-inline">馭</span> “to handle or train a horse,” <span class="kanji-inline">御</span> could also substitute for that character and be used for the ideas of a horse and of driving or handling one. In Japanese it functions widely as an honorific prefix (on-, o-, mi-).</p>
