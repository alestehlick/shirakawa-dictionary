    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">貿</span> is a phono-semantic character that combines <span class="kanji-inline">貝</span>, the cowry shell used in antiquity as money, with <span class="kanji-inline">卯</span> as the phonetic. In early forms <span class="kanji-inline">卯</span> depicts the sacrificial meat cut into two, conveying the idea of splitting and, by extension, exchanging counterparts. Set alongside <span class="kanji-inline">貝</span>, which points to valuables and currency, the character comes to mean exchanging by means of money—buying, selling, and bartering—as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">貿</span><span class="kanji-inline">易</span>. Classical usage, such as the Lüshi Chunqiu line <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="男.html">男</a><span class="kanji-inline">女</span><span class="kanji-inline">貿</span><span class="kanji-inline">功</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="以.html">以</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="長.html">長</a><span class="kanji-inline">生</span>, shows <span class="kanji-inline">貿</span> in the sense of exchanging one’s tasks or work in order to sustain life.</p>
