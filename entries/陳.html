    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its oldest form the character is written as <span class="kanji-inline">敶</span>, a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">陳</span> with <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>. In bronze inscriptions it appears in several graphic types: one writes the sense seen in the word for display (as in chinretsu), another employs the state name Chen as a phonetic, and yet another uses the Chen clan name known from the Tian Qi lineage. The left element <span class="kanji-inline">阝</span> (from <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span>) depicts the sacred stepped ladder by which the gods ascend and descend. The graph shows a war chariot set before this divine ladder, the spot regarded as the army’s main camp. From the image of chariots standing side by side in that camp, the meaning broadened to “arrange,” “line up,” and “place in a row,” whence the senses expressed by tsuraneru and naraberu.</p>
