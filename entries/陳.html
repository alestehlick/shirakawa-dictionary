    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph of <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">阝</span>) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="東.html">東</a>. Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span> as the gods’ ladder for ascent and descent between heaven and earth, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="東.html">東</a> as the figure of a tied sack (a bag for offerings). Setting the bag before the sacred ladder evokes the act of laying out offerings in orderly rows. Bronze inscriptions reinforce this ritual scene by showing the offerings arranged before the earth deity, further rooting the character in the idea of display and arrangement. From this core sense it comes to mean “to line up, to set out” (tsuraneru), and by extension “to state, to set forth” (noberu) as in chinjutsu and chinsetsu, while the image of things left arrayed over time yields the sense “old, long-continued” (hisashii).</p>
