    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the element <span class="kanji-inline">羽</span> conveys the idea of feathers and wings, while <span class="kanji-inline">異</span> serves as the phonetic, indicating the on reading yoku. In bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">異</span> itself was used with the senses of helping and guarding, seen in expressions glossed as yokurin, “to take someone under one’s wing,” and kyuyoku, “reward and protection.” <span class="kanji-inline">異</span> thus stands as the original graph, and with the later addition of <span class="kanji-inline">羽</span> the form became <span class="kanji-inline">翼</span>, making the image of a wing explicit. The Shuowen straightforwardly glosses it as hane, “wing(s).”</p>
