    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羽.html">羽</a> conveys the idea of feathers and wings, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="異.html">異</a> serves as the phonetic, indicating the on reading yoku. In bronze inscriptions, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="異.html">異</a> itself was used with the senses of helping and guarding, seen in expressions glossed as yokurin, “to take someone under one’s wing,” and kyuyoku, “reward and protection.” <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="異.html">異</a> thus stands as the original graph, and with the later addition of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羽.html">羽</a> the form became <span class="kanji-inline">翼</span>, making the image of a wing explicit. The Shuowen straightforwardly glosses it as hane, “wing(s).”</p>
