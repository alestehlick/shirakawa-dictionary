    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">探</span> is a phono-semantic character: the hand radical shows the act, while the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">罙</span> supplies the sound and the image. In early forms <span class="kanji-inline">罙</span> depicts a light being lowered into a pit—fire used to look for something hidden. The same phonetic appears in <span class="kanji-inline">琛</span> (chin, “jewel”), marking the series. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">探</span> originally meant to hold up a light and search within a hole, and by extension came to mean seeking what is concealed: to feel one’s way, investigate, inquire, or pay a visit to ask. The Shuowen glosses it as “to take something distant,” capturing the idea of reaching out for what lies beyond immediate sight.</p>
