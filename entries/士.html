    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest forms, this character draws the head of a small broadax with the blade pointing downward. It was not a practical weapon but a ceremonial implement that marked social rank, identifying one who served the king in the warrior class. By contrast, the character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="王.html">王</a> depicts the head of a large broadax set before the royal throne as a symbol of the king himself. From this origin in martial service, <span class="kanji-inline">士</span> broadened in use to denote those in official posts—civil servants, judges—and, more generally, a man or gentleman.</p>
