    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">圓</span>, this is a phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="員.html">員</a> as its core, providing the sound en. In Shirakawa’s reading, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="員.html">員</a> depicts a round object set atop a rounded ding tripod <span class="kanji-inline">鼎</span>—an ancient bronze vessel used in ritual—whose form is abbreviated as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a> in the graph; this arrangement itself conveyed the idea of roundness. When <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="員.html">員</a> later developed other meanings, the form with an added outer circular enclosure, <span class="kanji-inline">圓</span>, was used specifically to express “round” and “circle,” a sense that continues in the modern simplified form <span class="kanji-inline">円</span>.</p>
