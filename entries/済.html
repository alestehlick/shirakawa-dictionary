    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">濟</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the water element combines with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">齊</span>, whose form depicts a woman in sacred service arranging her hair with three vertical hairpins—a picture of things neatly regulated and brought to a close. With water added, the image becomes that of completing a crossing, and by extension bringing matters to completion. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">済</span> comes to mean to accomplish and to have something be settled or concluded. In Japanese it appears in uses such as ki ga sumu, “to feel satisfied,” and shakkin o sumasu, “to pay one’s debts,” reflecting this core sense of finishing and setting things right.</p>
