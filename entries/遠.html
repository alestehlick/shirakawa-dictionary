    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">遠</span> as a phono-semantic compound: the movement sign <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> (“to go”) is joined to the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">袁</span> (en). He reads <span class="kanji-inline">袁</span> as a funerary image—a piece of jade hung at the neckband of a burial garment for a spirit‑invoking rite, with the sign <span class="kanji-inline">之</span>, originally shaped like a footprint meaning “to go,” placed at the pillow to send the deceased on the journey to the other world. In later script the <span class="kanji-inline">之</span> element appears as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a>. With <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> added to this base, the character shows the act of going off to a distance, and so comes to mean “far, remote.”</p>
