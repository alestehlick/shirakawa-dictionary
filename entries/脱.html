    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">脱</span> is a phono-semantic character whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">脫</span>, built on <span class="kanji-inline">兌</span> as its phonetic. In the ancient graphs <span class="kanji-inline">兌</span> shows the light descent of divine breath, marked by the sign <span class="kanji-inline">八</span>, upon a shaman figure (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="兄.html">兄</a>), depicting a trance-like, slackened state under possession; the related character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="悦.html">悦</a> captures that inner state of mind. From this idea of loosening and depletion, adding the flesh sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> (the “meat/flesh” element) turns the scene to the body: what is slackened is bodily substance, so things drop away or slip free. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">脱</span> comes to mean to come off or fall out, to slip out or get free (escape), and by extension to take off clothing, as in <span class="kanji-inline">脱</span><span class="kanji-inline">衣</span>.</p>
