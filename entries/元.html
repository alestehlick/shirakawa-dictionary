    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the earliest script, this character is a pictograph: an enlarged human head with the side view of a body (the person element) set beneath it, a drawing that emphatically foregrounds the head. From this focus it first means “head,” and by extension the “head” as leader or sovereign, as in <span class="kanji-inline">元</span><span class="kanji-inline">首</span>. Because the head is the highest part, the graph naturally came to mark what stands at the start or serves as the source: the beginning of time in <span class="kanji-inline">元</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>, and the fundamental basis in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="根.html">根</a><span class="kanji-inline">元</span>. In usage it carries the senses kashira (leader), moto (basis), and hajime (beginning), and its on reading and sense sometimes overlap with those of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="原.html">原</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="玄.html">玄</a>.</p>
