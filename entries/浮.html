    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">浮</span> as a phono-semantic graph: the water element provides the scene, while <span class="kanji-inline">孚</span> serves as the phonetic fu and depicts a hand placed over a child—an image of grasping, also seen in <span class="kanji-inline">俘</span>. Together they picture reaching down from above to pull up a child who has fallen into water, giving the senses “to float,” “to rise to the surface,” and “to drift.” Related graphs refine the posture of a body borne by water: <span class="kanji-inline">泛</span> shows a drowned person floating face up, and <span class="kanji-inline">汜</span>, face down. By extension, <span class="kanji-inline">浮</span> comes to describe things without firm footing, as in <span class="kanji-inline">浮</span><span class="kanji-inline">言</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">浮</span><span class="kanji-inline">説</span>—rumors with no real ground.</p>
