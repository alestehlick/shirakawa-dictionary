    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa traces this character to the older form <span class="kanji-inline">曆</span>, built by combining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="麻.html">麻</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>. The <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="麻.html">麻</a> element itself joins the cliff shape <span class="kanji-inline">厂</span> with a sign depicting two uprights set up under a cliff to form a military gate—the emblem of an army headquarters. Set before this, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a> is understood not as the sun, but as the ritual covenant receptacle that holds written prayers to the gods. Placing that sacred vessel at the military gate evokes the formal proclamation and recognition of wartime merit, yielding the original sense isaoshi, “distinguished service.” Only later did the character come to be used for koyomi, “calendar,” and by extension for “number” and “to count.”</p>
