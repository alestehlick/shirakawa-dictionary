    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph of three <span class="kanji-inline">口</span> set in a row, where <span class="kanji-inline">口</span> is not a mouth but, in Shirakawa’s reading, the sai: a sacred receptacle for slips bearing written prayers and covenants to the gods. Arraying many such vessels suggests collective recitation and the accumulation of petitions; from this image the character came to signify multiplicity and assortment—kinds, varieties, numbers—and by extension goods and articles. Related graphs elaborate the same ritual scene: <span class="kanji-inline">區</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">区</span>) shows many such vessels prayed over in a secluded place; <span class="kanji-inline">歐</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">欧</span>) emphasizes praying in a loud voice; <span class="kanji-inline">謳</span> gives that prayerful voice as song; and <span class="kanji-inline">毆</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">殴</span>) depicts urging a prayer’s fulfillment by striking the vessels with a pike (<span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>).</p>
