    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the ancient script, <span class="kanji-inline">皆</span> is formed by combining <span class="kanji-inline">比</span>, the image of two people standing side by side, with a ritual container into which a written prayer is placed. The graph thus evokes the deities descending in orderly ranks in response to a summons conveyed by that prayer—an act expressed elsewhere by the character <span class="kanji-inline">召</span>. From this image of all the gods coming down together, the character came to mean “all, everyone.” When speaking specifically of people acting together, one writes <span class="kanji-inline">偕</span> (“together”), as in the phrase <span class="kanji-inline">偕</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="老.html">老</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="同.html">同</a><span class="kanji-inline">穴</span>, “to grow old together and be buried in the same grave.”</p>
