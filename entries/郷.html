    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">郷</span> as a compound pictograph. In the old forms, <span class="kanji-inline">卯</span> depicts two people seated facing one another, and beside it appears the gui (ki), a ritual food vessel used to serve offerings after ancestral worship. Together they picture the banquet held after the rites: two people confronting each other with the vessel set between them, which gave rise to senses such as “to face” and “banquet” (kyoen). From this ceremonial setting, <span class="kanji-inline">卿</span> came to denote the high-ranking guests invited to such feasts, and <span class="kanji-inline">郷</span> the territory under those ministers. To signal that territorial meaning, later scribes added the settlement element on both sides, creating the present form and distinguishing it from <span class="kanji-inline">卿</span>; in antiquity the two graphs were the same. In later usage <span class="kanji-inline">郷</span> came to mean one’s native village and countryside, the home district.</p>
