    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines the water element with <span class="kanji-inline">朶</span>, a graph showing boughs and leaves hanging down. It evokes the image of foliage being steeped in water to take on color—dyeing by soaking plant material. As recorded in the Zhou Rites, different grasses yielded specific dye colors, and in antiquity grasses and woods were widely used as dye sources for threads and garments. From this core sense of applying color, the meaning broadened to the way a liquid sinks in and permeates—staining and soaking through—hence readings like shimiru and shimu, and the intransitive somaru “to become dyed.” By extension it came to express being colored or tainted in a figurative sense, which underlies compounds such as kansen and densen for infection and osen for pollution, where an influence spreads and “colors” what it touches.</p>
