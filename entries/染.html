    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines the water element with <span class="kanji-inline">朶</span>, the image of drooping branches and leaves, and originally depicts foliage being soaked so that it takes on color—an early scene of dyeing with plant-derived pigments. Ancient ritual texts even describe officials in charge of dyes and the colors obtained from various grasses and woods. From this concrete act of coloring, the sense broadened to anything that seeps in and leaves its tint: to be dyed, to soak or permeate, and by extension to be affected or tainted, as reflected in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="感.html">感</a><span class="kanji-inline">染</span> (infection), <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="伝.html">伝</a><span class="kanji-inline">染</span> (contagion), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="汚.html">汚</a><span class="kanji-inline">染</span> (pollution).</p>
