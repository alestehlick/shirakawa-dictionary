    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">連</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="車.html">車</a> and the movement indicator <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span>, forming a compound that early lexica gloss as “to carry” or “to bear on the shoulder,” evoking a shoulder-pole with a basket used for transport. In sense it converges with <span class="kanji-inline">聯</span>, whose ancient image is of threading trophies—the severed ears of enemies—onto a cord, a stark picture of items strung together in a row. From this concrete idea of things joined and following one after another, <span class="kanji-inline">連</span> comes to mean linking, arranging in sequence, and continuing. In Japanese usage the meaning naturally extends to leading or taking someone along, as when walking a dog or going out with a child in tow.</p>
