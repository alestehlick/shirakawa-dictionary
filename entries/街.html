    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with <span class="kanji-inline">圭</span> as the phonetic and <span class="kanji-inline">行</span> as the semantic core. <span class="kanji-inline">圭</span>, which also marks the on-reading in characters like <span class="kanji-inline">厓</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="涯.html">涯</a>, originally depicted a rectangular clay tablet made from earth on which divination results were inscribed. Streets laid out in orderly, rectilinear fashion were likened to the neat grid of that tablet, hence terms such as gaido (<span class="kanji-inline">街</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="道.html">道</a>) and gairo (<span class="kanji-inline">街</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="路.html">路</a>) for wide, purpose-built roads. The component <span class="kanji-inline">行</span> portrays a crossroads and contributes meanings of a four-way junction, road, town, and quarter, from which the sense “street; city quarter” arises.</p>
