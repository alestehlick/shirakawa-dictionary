    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character built with the person radical on the left and <span class="kanji-inline">旦</span> on the right as the phonetic, indicating the On reading tan. Early sources such as the Shuowen link this graph to the idea of baring the shoulder (tan), as in <span class="kanji-inline">袒</span>, showing how <span class="kanji-inline">旦</span> functions as a shared phonetic in words read tan. From that phonetic value the character was later borrowed to write the native sense tada, “just; only.” In Japanese it is read tadashi in legal and expository style to introduce exceptions or conditions, as in tadashigaki, a proviso clause.</p>
