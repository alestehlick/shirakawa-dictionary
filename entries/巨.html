    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a carpenter’s square, a right-angled ruler. The slight swelling depicted at its center marks the handgrip; in some bronze inscriptions a human figure (written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>) is even added to show someone grasping it. In contrast to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="規.html">規</a>, the compass used to draw circles, the square (<span class="kanji-inline">矩</span>) draws straight lines and right angles, and together <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="規.html">規</a><span class="kanji-inline">矩</span> came to signify standards or rules. Later, <span class="kanji-inline">巨</span> was borrowed to write <span class="kanji-inline">鉅</span>, so it also took on the sense of “big, huge.”</p>
