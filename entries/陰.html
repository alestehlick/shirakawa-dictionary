    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In early forms, the left element of <span class="kanji-inline">陰</span> is the sacred ladder (later written as the mound radical <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span>) on which the gods ascend and descend. The right side is the old graph <span class="kanji-inline">侌</span>, depicting <span class="kanji-inline">云</span> “clouds” confined beneath <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="今.html">今</a>, a lid with a stopper—an image of vapors and pneuma being shut in. In contrast to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="陽.html">陽</a>, which places the radiant sun or jade light before the divine ladder to signify brightness, <span class="kanji-inline">陰</span> shows that light enclosed and the divine breath confined. From this image arise its senses of shutting and covering, and thus the ideas of shade, shadow, and a sky growing overcast; by extension it also comes to mean secrecy and concealment. As a related form, <span class="kanji-inline">蔭</span> names the cool shade cast by luxuriant grass. In thought, <span class="kanji-inline">陰</span> stands in complementary balance with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="陽.html">陽</a> as the yin half of the cosmic pair.</p>
