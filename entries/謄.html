    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa takes <span class="kanji-inline">謄</span> as a phono-semantic character. Its original form is <span class="kanji-inline">謄</span>, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="朕.html">朕</a> functioning as the phonetic element that gives the on reading; the same <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="朕.html">朕</a> appears in related characters like <span class="kanji-inline">滕</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="騰.html">騰</a>, which share the reading tō. In Shirakawa’s view, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="朕.html">朕</a> originally depicts a tray-like vessel (with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> reflecting the boat-shaped form) and conveys the act of offering something placed on a plate and presented with both hands; <span class="kanji-inline">賸</span> likewise points to presenting goods or money. Combined with the speech element, <span class="kanji-inline">謄</span> takes on the meaning recorded in the Shuowen: to transcribe in writing, to take down a faithful copy. Hence compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">謄</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="写.html">写</a>, ‘to copy by writing,’ and <span class="kanji-inline">謄</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="本.html">本</a>, ‘a written duplicate of an original,’ used for official copies of family registers and other records.</p>
