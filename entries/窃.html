    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form of <span class="kanji-inline">窃</span> is <span class="kanji-inline">竊</span>, a compound that sets <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="穴.html">穴</a>, an underground chamber, over <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="米.html">米</a>, grain, together with a component that depicts small insects clustering. It pictures rice stored in a cellar being quietly overrun and eaten by swarming pests—grain that disappears out of sight. From this hidden, unseen consumption arise the senses “in secret” and “to steal.” A related graphic idea appears in <span class="kanji-inline">蠹</span>, which shows two insects within a grain sack (<span class="kanji-inline">橐</span>), emblematic of cereal pests. In this way, <span class="kanji-inline">窃</span> conveys the notion of stealthy taking, like grain vanishing in the dark of a storage pit.</p>
