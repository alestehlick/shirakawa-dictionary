    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally this graph shows a woman with her hair bound up and set with ornaments. In bronze inscriptions it carries the sense of earnest exertion—being diligent and making an effort. The related character <span class="kanji-inline">敏</span>, whose ancient form combines <span class="kanji-inline">毎</span> with <span class="kanji-inline">又</span> “hand,” pictures a hand added to the hair ornament, arranging it in readiness; from this image it conveys zealous, attentive engagement in ritual. The familiar meanings “always” and “each time, every” arose later as a loan usage attached to its Chinese reading.</p>
