    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">害</span> as a ritual image. In the ancient forms the component at the core is not a mouth, but sai, a sacred receptacle used to hold written covenants and petitions to the gods. Paired with it is a large, handled needle driven into that vessel, picturing the act of piercing and tearing the prayers, thereby nullifying their efficacy. From this scene the character took on senses such as to hurt, to disturb, and to spoil, with disaster or misfortune arising as the consequence of that spoiling. He compares <span class="kanji-inline">舎</span>(<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舍.html">舍</a>), which shows a smaller needle being thrust in and yields the meaning to discard or abandon. In later standardized shapes the needle’s point was visually blunted, but the original graph clearly depicts a pointed instrument damaging the sacred container—hence “harm.”</p>
