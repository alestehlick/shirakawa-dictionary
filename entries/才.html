    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">才</span> as a pictograph of a wooden signpost erected to mark and sanctify a spot. A horizontal bar is set at the top of the post, and to it is attached a sacred receptacle for covenant writings offered to the gods. By fixing this token, the place becomes ritually charged—much like the Japanese practice of enclosing a worship site with brushwood (shiba) to invite the descent of deities. In this light, <span class="kanji-inline">才</span> originally means “to be, to exist” as the presence within a consecrated space, and it stands as the early form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="在.html">在</a>. Bronze inscriptions use <span class="kanji-inline">才</span> in this sense, as in phrases like “<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="正.html">正</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a><span class="kanji-inline">才</span>,” meaning “it is New Year.” Later, by adding the head of a small broadax, the graph becomes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="在.html">在</a>, “to exist; to live,” and the compound <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="存.html">存</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="在.html">在</a> thus evokes a sacred kind of being. When new tools were made, they were purified and marked with <span class="kanji-inline">才</span> as a protective sign, akin to a charm. Affixed to the blade of a halberd, this element also signals “beginning,” giving rise to characters such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="裁.html">裁</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="栽.html">栽</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="載.html">載</a>. The modern sense of “talent” reflects an ability thought to be present from the start—an inner endowment rooted in that original idea of consecrated presence.</p>
