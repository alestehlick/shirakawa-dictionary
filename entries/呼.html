    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">呼</span> is a phono-semantic character built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> “mouth” and <span class="kanji-inline">乎</span> as its phonetic. The element <span class="kanji-inline">乎</span> was originally the full character for this word and depicted a rattling plate (naruko): a small board tied to another by a cord that clacks when shaken, used to call people, drive birds, and, in origin, to summon deities in ritual. From this instrument’s use, <span class="kanji-inline">乎</span> carried the senses “to call” and “to cry out.” When <span class="kanji-inline">乎</span> later came to function in Chinese as a grammatical particle, a new graph was created for the verbal meaning by adding the mouth sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>, yielding <span class="kanji-inline">呼</span>, explicitly marking a vocal act. From the notion of expelling sound from the mouth, the usage broadened to “exhale” or “breathe out.”</p>
