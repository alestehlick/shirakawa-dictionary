    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a kitchen hearth with a pot set upon it. From the image of food thoroughly cooked on the stove, it came to express degree—“very,” “intense,” “extreme.” Related graphs illuminate the scene: <span class="kanji-inline">斟</span> shows ladling out something well cooked with a dipper (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斗.html">斗</a>), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="酌.html">酌</a> depicts drawing drink from a cask; together they yield <span class="kanji-inline">斟</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="酌.html">酌</a>, literally “ladling and measuring,” hence the idea of weighing things with careful consideration. When the fire element was added to <span class="kanji-inline">甚</span>, a character for the stove itself was formed. From the savoring of a well-prepared meal, the sense broadened to enjoyment more generally, coloring words for pleasure—at times even erotic delight—and <span class="kanji-inline">湛</span> can also stand in this role, meaning to enjoy or to be deeply absorbed, alongside its basic sense “to sink.”</p>
