    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form <span class="kanji-inline">獻</span> combines the dog element with a vessel shaped like a li-kettle, akin to a ding tripod. It points to a rite in which the blood of a sacrificial dog was used to purify and consecrate ritual containers, particularly at completion ceremonies for important structures; such vessels, once purified, were employed to hold offerings to the gods. From this core image of consecrating a li-type vessel for worship, the character comes to mean to present respectfully, to dedicate, and to offer, and by extension to recommend something to another.</p>
