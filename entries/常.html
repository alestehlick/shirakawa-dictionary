    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">常</span> is a phono-semantic character built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尚.html">尚</a> as its phonetic, with the cloth element <span class="kanji-inline">巾</span> added. The Shuowen glosses <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尚.html">尚</a> as the lower train of a garment, linking the composite form to the trailing hem (<span class="kanji-inline">裳</span>). In bronze inscriptions, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尚.html">尚</a> already appears with the sense of constancy, as in the line <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="必.html">必</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尚.html">尚</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="卑.html">卑</a><span class="kanji-inline">厥</span><span class="kanji-inline">處</span><span class="kanji-inline">邑</span>, meaning let him always dwell in his village. From the notion of a garment’s train whose length is fixed by rule, the character took on the ideas of standard and norm, which then broadened into temporal senses such as habitual, usual, and always. It can also stand in for <span class="kanji-inline">嘗</span> with the meaning once, and in Japanese it includes the reading toko in words like <span class="kanji-inline">常</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夏.html">夏</a>, everlasting summer.</p>
