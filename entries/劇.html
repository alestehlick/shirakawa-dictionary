    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa understands <span class="kanji-inline">劇</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="慶.html">慶</a> and the knife radical <span class="kanji-inline">刂</span>. He takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="慶.html">慶</a> to depict a performer wearing a tiger’s hide in a sham ritual, a figure adopted for ceremonial display. In ancient rites, a staged cutting of this costumed person symbolized the subduing of traitors and was performed before the gods and at altars as a prayer for victory. The vigorous, vehement movements of this rite gave the character its sense of “intense, severe, violent,” while the stylized acting and gestures later yielded the meaning “drama, play.” A related graph, <span class="kanji-inline">戲</span>, likewise arose from ceremonies of praying for victory.</p>
