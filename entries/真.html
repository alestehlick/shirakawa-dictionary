    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form of <span class="kanji-inline">真</span> is <span class="kanji-inline">眞</span>, which joins two stark images: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="七.html">七</a>, taken here as the figure of a person inverted in death, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="県.html">県</a>, the image of a head hung upside down. Together they portray one who has suddenly fallen and died in the open. Such an unexpected death was thought to produce a powerful, vengeful spirit, and early ritual centered on appeasing it: bowing before the fallen (as in <span class="kanji-inline">顛</span>, to topple), setting the dead respectfully in a small roadside shrine (<span class="kanji-inline">祠</span>), placing upon a seat a spiritually potent jewel (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="玉.html">玉</a>), enshrining the presence (<span class="kanji-inline">鎭</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="座.html">座</a>), calming its wrath (<span class="kanji-inline">鎭</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鎮.html">鎮</a>), and acting with circumspection and reverence (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="慎.html">慎</a>). Many graphs built on <span class="kanji-inline">眞</span> reflect facets of this pacification rite. In time, the graph that once marked the fallen dead came to signify what is ultimate and enduring—‘the true’—in line with an ancient view that human life is brief and provisional, while the realm after death is eternal. The shift parallels <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="久.html">久</a>, which originally depicted supporting a corpse from behind and later came to mean ‘long-lasting.’</p>
