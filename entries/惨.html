    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">慘</span>, this character is a phono-semantic compound: the heart element (<span class="kanji-inline">忄</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">心</span>) anchors the sense in emotion, while <span class="kanji-inline">參</span> supplies the sound, yielding the on reading san. The Shuowen glosses it as “poison,” a figurative note that captures suffering that bites into the heart, hence the idea of a grievous, pitiable state. Within this phonetic series, forms read san often carry a sorrowful, desolate resonance, reflected in compounds like hisan (tragic, pitiable), sanbi (heart-wrenching), and sansei (bleak and sad). Thus <span class="kanji-inline">惨</span> came to denote what is wretched or pitiful, and by extension the cruel extremity of pain and lament.</p>
