    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound, early forms of this graph are written as <span class="kanji-inline">荣</span>. The plant radical <span class="kanji-inline">艹</span> signals vegetation, while the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">采</span> (sai) depicts fingertips reaching over a tree to pluck fruit, conveying both sound and the notion of gathering. Together they designate edible plants—greens cultivated on tilled fields—that came to mean “vegetables.” In antiquity such greens were more than daily fare: they were offered as shinsen, sacred food set before the deities. The Book of Rites even notes that at the start of lessons in higher schools, teachers would present herbs in ritual offering as a mark of reverence for the Way.</p>
