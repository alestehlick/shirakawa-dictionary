    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">既</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">自</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">旡</span>. It pictures a person who, after eating, turns away with a full belly and lets out a belch, the utensil element <span class="kanji-inline">自</span> set before him. From this vivid scene of a meal brought to completion, the character takes on the senses of coming to an end and already having been done. Related graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">嘅</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="慨.html">慨</a> carry this meaning forward, turning the released breath after completion into the sigh and lament they express.</p>
