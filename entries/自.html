    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally a pictograph of a nose seen from the front, this graph took on the sense of “self” because people traditionally pointed to the nose when referring to themselves. In oracle-bone inscriptions it already appears in the construction <span class="kanji-inline">自</span>…<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="至.html">至</a>…, meaning “from … to …,” with <span class="kanji-inline">自</span> functioning as “from.” As the character came to be used primarily for “self, oneself,” a new graph, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鼻.html">鼻</a>, was created to write “nose,” formed by adding <span class="kanji-inline">畀</span> beneath <span class="kanji-inline">自</span> as a phonetic element, evoking the sound of nasal breathing.</p>
