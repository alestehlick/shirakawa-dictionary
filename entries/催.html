    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">崔</span> as its phonetic, giving the on-reading sai. <span class="kanji-inline">崔</span>, as seen in the word <span class="kanji-inline">崔</span><span class="kanji-inline">嵬</span> meaning “high and steep,” evokes the image of a lofty, precipitous mountain that seems to exert a compelling force on people. Characters built with <span class="kanji-inline">崔</span> often carry this sense of strong pressure or forceful advance—compare <span class="kanji-inline">摧</span>, “to smash.” In <span class="kanji-inline">催</span>, that impetus becomes social and active: to set things in motion, convene and sponsor gatherings, and press or urge others to act.</p>
