    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">尚</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="向.html">向</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="八.html">八</a>. In early forms, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="向.html">向</a> shows a ritual sai—a covenant vessel for written prayers—set at a window where light streams in as one worships the gods. The <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="八.html">八</a> marks the sign that appears and seems to hang in the air. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">尚</span> depicts the faint manifestation of a divine sign at that sacred moment. This epiphany, associated with a trance-like state during supplication, gave rise to senses such as to esteem and high, and by extension the adverbial uses still, yet, and furthermore.</p>
