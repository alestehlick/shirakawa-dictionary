    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">据</span> is a phono-semantic character: the hand radical signals an action done by hand, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="居.html">居</a> serves as the phonetic element (giving the On reading kyo). The original sense is tactile and concrete—pressing or fixing something firmly in place with the fingertips, to the point of fingertip strain. From this comes the broader idea of setting or planting something solidly, laying or placing it, and, by extension, leaving it as it is. This nuance is felt in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">拮</span><span class="kanji-inline">据</span>, where <span class="kanji-inline">拮</span> suggests agitated hand movement and <span class="kanji-inline">据</span> evokes the straining pressure of the fingertips, and in expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">据</span><span class="kanji-inline">傲</span>, where it historically alternates with <span class="kanji-inline">倨</span> in the sense of a haughty bearing.</p>
