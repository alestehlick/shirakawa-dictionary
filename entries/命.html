    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">命</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="令.html">令</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>. In Shirakawa’s view, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="令.html">令</a> shows a kneeling officiant wearing a deep ceremonial hood as they receive a revelation from the gods, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> here is not a mouth but the ritual receptacle (sai) that holds prayer texts or covenant documents. The character thus signifies what is bestowed as a divine message in response to prayer—hence a mandate or command. Because human life was regarded as Heaven’s bestowal, the graph also came to mean “life,” and by extension “destiny” or “fate.” In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="令.html">令</a> often appears with the value of <span class="kanji-inline">命</span>, indicating that <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="令.html">令</a> is the original form for this concept.</p>
