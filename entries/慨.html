    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character built on the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="既.html">既</a> (ancient form <span class="kanji-inline">旣</span>). In that old form, <span class="kanji-inline">旡</span> depicts a person with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="自.html">自</a>, a piece of tableware, set before him; having eaten his fill, he turns away and belches, which gave <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="既.html">既</a> the sense of “already, finished.” When the heart radical <span class="kanji-inline">心</span> was added to this image, the bodily motion came to be read as an emotional gesture—a deep, regretful sigh—so the character took on the meanings “to deplore, to lament.” By extension it can also convey indignant anger or mournful sorrow.</p>
