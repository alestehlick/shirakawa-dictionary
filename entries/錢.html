    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a phono-semantic compound: the metal radical signals something made of metal, while the phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">戔</span> provides the sound sen and originally depicted long, narrow halberds stacked in a flat pile, suggesting thin things heaped up. Early sources show that the word first named a field implement—hoe or plow—and the Book of Odes celebrates sacred field work with a line that pairs tools as <span class="kanji-inline">錢</span><span class="kanji-inline">縛</span>, “hoe and plow.” Only later did the graph come to denote copper coinage, zeni; in early times, such currency even took the form of small knife-shaped pieces, known as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幣.html">幣</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="布.html">布</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貨.html">貨</a>. Thus the graph moved from the world of agricultural tools into the sphere of metal money, while retaining its phonetic value and metal radical.</p>
