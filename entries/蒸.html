    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">蒸</span> is a phono-semantic character built with <span class="kanji-inline">烝</span> as its phonetic, which points to the Sino-Japanese reading jo. The Shuowen explains the original referent as ogara: the inner hemp stalk stripped of its bark and used as a wick or torch—what is commonly called makotsuho. Light and easily bundled, such stalks served as brushwood alongside firewood, as in the pair <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="薪.html">薪</a><span class="kanji-inline">蒸</span>. From this concrete image, the character’s sense broadened: first to the act and effect of heating until vapor rises—‘to steam’ and the sultry, muggy condition that results—and, by association with <span class="kanji-inline">烝</span>, further to the idea of ‘many, in great number.’</p>
