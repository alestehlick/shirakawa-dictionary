    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">顧</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="雇.html">雇</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span>. <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span> shows, in profile, a person wearing a ritual cap and bowing in reverence. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="雇.html">雇</a> depicts placing a short‑tailed bird before the divine tablet to perform bird divination and seek the god’s will. Together they portray reverently receiving a divine pronouncement. From this sacred act arise senses of grace and of holding something deeply in mind (as in <span class="kanji-inline">顧</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="念.html">念</a>). These then extend to human affairs: to show mercy or consideration, to be mindful, and, by further extension, to look back or turn around in reflection upon what has been revealed.</p>
