    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">傷</span> as a phono-semantic character: the person radical <span class="kanji-inline">亻</span> sets the sphere of human affairs, while the right-hand element <span class="kanji-inline">昜</span> serves as the phonetic and preserves the imagery of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="易.html">易</a>. In that older form, a sacred jade is set on a stand with its radiance streaming downward, evoking the tamafuri rite that stirs the spirit and enriches human vitality. <span class="kanji-inline">昜</span>, however, shows that force being covered from above—an obstruction of the rite—and thus signifies a weakening or depletion of human energy. Joined to the person element, it describes a state in which a person’s vitality is impeded or harmed. From this it comes to mean not only bodily wounds but also injuries of the heart—hurt, aching, grief, and sorrow.</p>
