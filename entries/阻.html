    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the right component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="且.html">且</a> serves as the phonetic and gives the on reading so, and it already carries the sense “to check, to obstruct.” The left component is <span class="kanji-inline">阝</span> (from <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span>), originally depicting the divine ladder by which gods ascended and descended; placing something upon it signifies setting up a barrier to block another’s approach. From this ritual image the character comes to mean barring or thwarting an intrusion. Classical usage confirms the concrete sense of natural impediments: in the Zhou Rites, officials are charged “to know the obstacles” posed by mountains, forests, rivers, and marshes, whence the extended sense seen in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="険.html">険</a><span class="kanji-inline">阻</span> “rugged, dangerous.” By further extension it can describe being held back or afflicted, as in being “blocked by hunger,” i.e., suffering from hunger.</p>
