    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a spoon: the upper element, written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>, sketches the bowl used for ladling, and the strokes below show the handle. That original graph, <span class="kanji-inline">是</span>, first wrote the utensil, but when its sound was borrowed for the abstract senses of “right” and “good,” the component <span class="kanji-inline">匕</span> was added to create <span class="kanji-inline">匙</span>, reserving that form for the spoon. In compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">是</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="非.html">非</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="非.html">非</a> is itself the figure of a fine‑toothed comb, and its negative value also comes from a phonetic loan. In classical usage, <span class="kanji-inline">是</span> can stand in for <span class="kanji-inline">此</span> or <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="時.html">時</a> and thus mean “this” or “these.”</p>
