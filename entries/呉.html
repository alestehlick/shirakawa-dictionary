    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its early form, <span class="kanji-inline">呉</span> combines the sign later written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="矢.html">矢</a>—understood here as the figure of a dancer inclining the head—with a box-like ritual vessel for covenants, a container into which written prayers to the gods were placed. The whole depicts a person who dances in supplication while holding the petition vessel, a rite meant to delight the deities so that a request might be fulfilled; from this comes the sense of enjoying or taking delight. Expressions describing someone dancing with easy grace echo this scene. The character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="娯.html">娯</a> (<span class="kanji-inline">娛</span>), “to amuse,” builds on this, with <span class="kanji-inline">呉</span> serving as its original graphic core. In later usage, <span class="kanji-inline">呉</span> also became the name of the ancient region and state of Wu.</p>
