    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form is <span class="kanji-inline">豫</span>, a phono-semantic graph with <span class="kanji-inline">予</span> supplying the sound. Classical sources gloss <span class="kanji-inline">豫</span> as a “great elephant,” and bronze inscriptional evidence—where the graph for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="猶.html">猶</a> appears as <span class="kanji-inline">猷</span> with the sense of worship and consulting the spirits—suggests an association with divining future matters, perhaps symbolically tied to the elephant. From this notion of foreknowledge the word came to mean “beforehand, in advance,” a sense already seen in early texts such as the Mencius. In modern general-use writing, <span class="kanji-inline">豫</span> is represented by <span class="kanji-inline">予</span>. Distinct from this is another graph <span class="kanji-inline">予</span>, originally a pictograph of a loom’s shuttle (<span class="kanji-inline">杼</span>), which later also served as an alternative to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a> for the first-person pronoun “I.”</p>
