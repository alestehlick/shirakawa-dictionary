    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">奮</span> combines the elements for garment (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衣.html">衣</a>), a bird (<span class="kanji-inline">隹</span>), and a device shaped like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a> used to bind the bird’s legs. It pictures a bird confined within clothing, its legs restrained, beating its wings in a bid to break free. From this vivid image arise senses such as fluttering, rousing, and exerting oneself. A related graph, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奪.html">奪</a>, shows hands reaching to seize a bird about to escape. Here the garment is understood as a funerary robe, and the bird is a bird-shaped spirit embodying the soul of the deceased; enclosing it in the robe was a way to make the soul abide there. The character thus preserves an ancient ritual scene from which its meanings of stirring and mustering effort naturally develop.</p>
