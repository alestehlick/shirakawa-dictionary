    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">險</span>, this is a phono-semantic graph. The left element <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span>, the ‘gods’ ladder,’ depicts a stepped height by which deities descend and ascend, evoking a lofty, precipitous sacred place. The right element <span class="kanji-inline">僉</span> supplies the sound (as in <span class="kanji-inline">儉</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="倹.html">倹</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">驗</span>, all read ken) and was once drawn as two people side by side, united in vow, presenting covenant vessels that held written prayers. In early usage, <span class="kanji-inline">險</span> referred to a protective prayer rite performed at such steep sacred sites; from that setting the character came to mean sheer and, by extension, dangerous. It also carried the idea of purifying a route before a procession, reflected in kendoshin, the attendants who led in front of the coffin during funerals.</p>
