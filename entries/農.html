    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">農</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a>, the field, with <span class="kanji-inline">辰</span>, originally the figure of a shellfish extending its foot. The character depicts working the earth with a shell-bladed implement—a mussel shell fixed to the end of a stick, a “venus shell” tool used to cut and till. In oracle-bone forms it appears with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="林.html">林</a> or <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="森.html">森</a> alongside <span class="kanji-inline">辰</span>, evoking the clearing of groves and fields with that tool as cultivation began. Over time the field element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a> came to be written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="曲.html">曲</a> within the received form of <span class="kanji-inline">農</span>. A bronze inscription on the Ling Tripod records <span class="kanji-inline">藉</span><span class="kanji-inline">農</span>, denoting communal cultivation of sacred fields to produce offerings for the gods, showing the word’s ritual associations. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">農</span> came to mean tilling and, by extension, agriculture. Relatedly, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辱.html">辱</a> portrays a hand wielding the same <span class="kanji-inline">辰</span>-tool and signifies cutting weeds—a reminder that farming begins with clearing grass.</p>
