    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">必</span> is a pictograph of the head of a weapon—a pike, halberd, or broad axe—fixed to its haft at the socket. In early writing it named that fitting itself, and as a sacred implement it figured in ritual. From this base grew a cluster of graphs tied to ritual solemnity and guarded conduct—<span class="kanji-inline">宓</span> (peaceful, calm), <span class="kanji-inline">祕</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="秘.html">秘</a> (secret), <span class="kanji-inline">密</span> (close, secret), <span class="kanji-inline">毖</span> (careful), and related shrine terms—originally referring to ceremonies employing that weapon-head as a sacred utensil. The familiar sense “certainly; without fail” is a later phonetic loan: bronze inscriptions actually write this adverb with <span class="kanji-inline">弋</span>, while <span class="kanji-inline">必</span> served its older, implement-based meaning (it is the original graph behind <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="秘.html">秘</a>/<span class="kanji-inline">祕</span>, with the separate form <span class="kanji-inline">袐</span> later created). Thus <span class="kanji-inline">必</span> first depicts the blade-head secured to the handle, and only later came to express inevitability.</p>
