    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the wood radical shows the material, while the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">全</span> supplies the on reading sen. Early lexicons gloss it as a nail or wooden nail, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丁.html">丁</a> evoking the nail’s head. From this image it came to mean a wooden stopper shaped like a nail, used to seal the mouth of a narrow-necked vessel. When such a stopper has a fluke or hook, the form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="今.html">今</a> appears; this element is seen, for example, in the original graph for “to drink” and in depictions of a wine vessel (<span class="kanji-inline">酉</span>) closed with a lid. In modern usage the sense extends to devices fitted to the end of pipes to open and shut the flow, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="給.html">給</a><span class="kanji-inline">水</span><span class="kanji-inline">栓</span> (water faucet) and <span class="kanji-inline">消</span><span class="kanji-inline">火</span><span class="kanji-inline">栓</span> (fire hydrant).</p>
