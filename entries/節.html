    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character written with the bamboo radical and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="即.html">即</a> as its sound element, <span class="kanji-inline">節</span> was already explained in the Shuowen as the joint of bamboo. In early times a bamboo node was split and inscribed to make a tally (warifu), the matching halves authenticating orders and messengers—hence terms like shisetsu (envoy) and the “bamboo envoy sign.” Archaeology corroborates this practice: in 1957 bronze joint tallies known as the E Jun Qi Jie—vehicle- and ship-pass tallies granted by the state of Chu to the lord of E in the fourth century BCE—were unearthed, laying out detailed rules for transit and provisions. From such regulated “tally orders” arose senses like setsudo (prescribed treatment, measured governance) and reisetsu (forms of etiquette), which further broadened to moderation and frugality (sessei, sekken, setsuyaku). By extension, the idea of fixed nodes in an ordered sequence yielded seasonal markers (setsuko) and patterned movement or sound (sesso, rhythm).</p>
