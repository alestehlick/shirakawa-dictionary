    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">節</span> is a phono-semantic character built from the bamboo radical and <span class="kanji-inline">卽</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="即.html">即</a>) as the phonetic, which gives the on-yomi setsu. In antiquity it named the node of bamboo, a segment that was split and inscribed to make tallies—authoritative tokens used as seals of office and proof for messengers. A vivid historical echo of this survives in the 1957 discovery of the E Jun Qi Jie tallies: fourth-century BCE land and water transit passes issued by the state of Chu to the ruler of E, which spelled out detailed rules for vehicles, boats, supplies, and procedures at checkpoints. From this core sense of a marked segment and an instrument that regulates conduct grew meanings related to prescribed treatment and decorum (etiquette), and further to proper measure in human behavior—moderation, integrity, self-restraint, and frugality. The image of a fixed division also naturally extended to the ordered divisions of time and movement, yielding senses such as season and rhythm.</p>
