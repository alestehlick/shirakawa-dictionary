    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">姉</span> is a phonosemantic character: the element <span class="kanji-inline">女</span> signals a woman, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="市.html">市</a> serves as the phonetic that gives the on-reading shi. The earlier form was <span class="kanji-inline">姊</span>. It belongs to a family of terms for elder women—alongside <span class="kanji-inline">姐</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">婆</span>—that once marked rank and social roles among women, from a motherly figure to the matron who led female ritual attendants. Within this lineage of titles for senior women, <span class="kanji-inline">姉</span> came to denote the elder sister.</p>
