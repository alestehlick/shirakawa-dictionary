    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">棺</span> as a phono-semantic character: the wood element marks a wooden object, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="官.html">官</a> supplies the sound kan and recalls its archaic form—a structure where sacrificial meat, borne with an army on campaign, was installed within a military post—carrying, by association with <span class="kanji-inline">綰</span> (“to bind, bundle”), the sense of enclosing and tying. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">棺</span> names the wooden chest that holds a shrouded body. The related character <span class="kanji-inline">椁</span> is the outer case into which the inner <span class="kanji-inline">棺</span> is placed; together <span class="kanji-inline">棺</span><span class="kanji-inline">椁</span> refers to the double coffin set used for high-ranking burials. In contrast, the word <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="葬.html">葬</a> (“funeral”) reflects the practice for commoners of leaving the body to weather and later gathering the bones for burial.</p>
