    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">賀</span> is a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">加</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">貝</span>. In Shirakawa’s reading, <span class="kanji-inline">加</span> depicts a ritual surrounding the plow: the force element is joined with the shape of a plow and a covenant vessel that held written prayers, expressing a ceremony to purify and protect the plow from insect harm. <span class="kanji-inline">貝</span> is the cowry, especially the blessed “koyasugai,” revered as a token of fertility and productive power. Together they portray a rite to enhance productivity and celebrate the advent of new life. From an origin in agricultural ceremony, the character broadened to mean praying for and celebrating life and abundance in general, and by extension, rejoicing and joy.</p>
