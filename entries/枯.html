    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the left side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> “tree, wood” gives the sense, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="古.html">古</a> supplies the on reading ko. In early writing, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="古.html">古</a> shows a sacred shield set upon a covenant coffer that held petitions to the deities, a rite meant to preserve the efficacy of prayers over time; hence its meaning “old.” When age has fully taken its course, trees lose their vitality and wither, and waters, too, run dry—so this character came to mean “to wither, to dry up.” Many graphs built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="古.html">古</a> carry this nuance of life-force ebbing away; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="故.html">故</a>, for example, speaks of the deceased, a field marked in ancient forms by the death-signifier <span class="kanji-inline">歹</span>. In this pattern, <span class="kanji-inline">枯</span> names the state in which the life of wood and plants has drained away.</p>
