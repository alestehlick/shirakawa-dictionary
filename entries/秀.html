    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a grain stalk (<span class="kanji-inline">禾</span>) at the moment of full bloom: the upper blossoms open and the pistil hangs down, capturing the plant at its most beautiful, distinguished stage. It belongs to a graphic lineage with <span class="kanji-inline">穆</span>, which shows the stage after flowering when the head swells with ripening grain (the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="白.html">白</a> element rendering the bursting crop), and <span class="kanji-inline">禿</span>, which depicts the bald stalk after the seeds have fallen. By naming that peak, flowering moment, <span class="kanji-inline">秀</span> came to signify what stands out as superior and, by extension, the act of excelling and a person of outstanding talent, as in the term <span class="kanji-inline">秀</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a>.</p>
