    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">量</span> is a pictograph built on the ancient form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="東.html">東</a>, which here does not mean “east” but sketches a sack tied at top and bottom—the original form of <span class="kanji-inline">橐</span> (taku), “sack.” In <span class="kanji-inline">量</span> a spout for pouring grain is drawn above this sack, while below it sits <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a>, used as a weight. The whole image is that of measuring grain with a sack and counterweight, hence the senses “to measure,” “measure/amount,” and, by extension, “to gauge” or “to infer,” as in suiryo and shinryo. A related graph, <span class="kanji-inline">重</span>, similarly shows the sack with a weight beneath; together as <span class="kanji-inline">重</span><span class="kanji-inline">量</span> they denote “weight.”</p>
