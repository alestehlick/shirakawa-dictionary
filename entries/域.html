    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">域</span> is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">或</span> as its sound element. In Shirakawa’s view, <span class="kanji-inline">或</span> depicts the city’s enclosing wall (the i) defended with a pike <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>, evoking a protected, bounded tract of land. When an added outer encircling is placed around <span class="kanji-inline">或</span>, it becomes <span class="kanji-inline">國</span>, the original form of <span class="kanji-inline">国</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">或</span> itself was once used to write <span class="kanji-inline">國</span>. Against this background, <span class="kanji-inline">域</span> denotes the realm governed within a city’s fortress walls and, by extension, a district or zone and the limits that partition or confine it. The same phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">或</span> appears in <span class="kanji-inline">閾</span> (shikii, threshold) and <span class="kanji-inline">棫</span> (a tree name), confirming its role as the on-reading marker.</p>
