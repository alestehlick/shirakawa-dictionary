    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">時</span> is a phono-semantic character. The sun graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a> sets the temporal scene, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寺.html">寺</a> provides the on reading ji and carries the sense of holding or maintaining—an idea that also lies behind <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="持.html">持</a>, to hold in the hand. Transferring this notion from physical grasp to duration, <span class="kanji-inline">時</span> came to express what is kept or sustained as time unfolds. Hence its everyday uses for toki (time, moment), extended to seasonal time as well. In the Analects (XV, 11), the phrase to follow the Xia division of time refers to adopting the Xia agricultural calendar, showing that <span class="kanji-inline">時</span> can also mean the calendar or regulated seasonal time.</p>
