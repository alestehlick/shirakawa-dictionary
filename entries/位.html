    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines the person graph <span class="kanji-inline">人</span> with <span class="kanji-inline">立</span>. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">立</span> itself is formed from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>, a front-facing figure with arms outstretched, set upon <span class="kanji-inline">一</span>, the ground line, depicting someone standing upright. With <span class="kanji-inline">人</span> added, the whole image points to a person at a fixed standing spot, and by extension to one’s proper station—kurai, “rank” or “position.” Earlier, <span class="kanji-inline">立</span> alone was used for this idea; later, <span class="kanji-inline">位</span> became the established form.</p>
