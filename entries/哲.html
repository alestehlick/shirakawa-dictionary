    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="折.html">折</a> (setsu) providing the sound, <span class="kanji-inline">哲</span> draws its imagery from ritual acts. In antiquity, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="折.html">折</a> depicted cutting grasses or wood with the ax <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斤.html">斤</a>—an action performed as a solemn gesture when swearing to the gods. In bronze inscriptions of <span class="kanji-inline">恝</span>, taken as the prototype of <span class="kanji-inline">哲</span>, some forms add the ax to the sign of the gods’ ladder, the ladder by which deities descend and ascend, suggesting the making of a divine ladder with an ax to welcome them. From this scene—pledging before the gods, preparing their descent, and fixing the mind in clarity—arises the sense of lucid realization and, by extension, intelligence and wisdom.</p>
