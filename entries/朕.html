    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the oldest forms the graph shows a tray-like vessel with both hands raised beneath it, depicting a person presenting something with both hands; from this came the sense of offering, a configuration that also underlies related characters. In Shang-period inscriptions <span class="kanji-inline">朕</span> appears alongside special style-names of princes such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="我.html">我</a>, and these later came to function as pronouns. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">朕</span> was adopted as the ruler’s self-referential “I,” a usage that, from the Qin unification onward, became the exclusive imperial first person. Apart from this courtly use, the character also carried the older sense of a sign or portent.</p>
