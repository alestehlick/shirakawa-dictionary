    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">官</span> as a compound of a roof and the figure of a sacrificial offering: under the eaves lies the “worship meat” that served as the army’s tutelary spirit. Before a campaign, troops offered meat at the army shrine, then bore it aloft as they set out; when encamped, it was installed in a building. <span class="kanji-inline">官</span> originally named that sacred place of enshrinement within the military encampment. Because generals resided there, the idea extended to their quarters, later written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="館.html">館</a>, for which <span class="kanji-inline">官</span> is the original graph. From the practice of dividing this meat when the army operated in detachments, related graphs arose: the figure of raising the offering led to <span class="kanji-inline">遣</span>, “to send, dispatch,” and the act of cutting the meat with a hilted knife defined <span class="kanji-inline">師</span>, the authorized military commander. On returning from campaign, reporting at the mausoleum and ritually purifying it produced <span class="kanji-inline">歸</span>, combining the offering, footprints of return, and a broom. In origin, characters built on this element belong to the sphere of military rites; only later did <span class="kanji-inline">官</span> come to mean the public office and the official who administers it.</p>
