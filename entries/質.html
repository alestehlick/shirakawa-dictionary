    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">質</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="所.html">所</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="所.html">所</a> is understood as two axes—tools for cutting—while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a> is taken not as a shell but as the form of a sacrificial tripod vessel (<span class="kanji-inline">鼎</span>), a bronze cooking vessel used in rites. In early forms, <span class="kanji-inline">質</span> depicts the act of cutting an inscription into a tripod with axes, thus marking a solemn appointment or contract; it could even denote the engraved document itself (as in shitsuzai). Related graphs such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="則.html">則</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="剤.html">剤</a> likewise show clauses cut into a tripod with a knife, all revolving around the idea of an engraved covenant. Because this engraved stipulation is the fixed basis of affairs, <span class="kanji-inline">質</span> comes to mean the foundation or essence (honshitsu), and by extension the act of pressing matters back to their basis in order to verify or rectify them (shitasu, shissei), as well as questioning that seeks first principles (shitsumon). From the starting point of a pledged, inscribed contract, the character thus spreads into senses like groundwork, inherent disposition, and even “hostage,” all tied to what is firmly bound or guaranteed.</p>
