    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the water element gives the sense of liquid, while the inner form, read shin, supplies the sound. At the core is a figure showing a hand holding a ritual broom, onto which fragrant liquor was sprinkled; with this broom one swept the mausoleum’s main hall to purify and exorcize it. The image is of the scent and moisture gradually seeping inward through the space. From this ritual scene the character comes to mean to soak or be steeped, and by extension to permeate or become wet.</p>
