    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The “lack” sense of this character goes back to an older form written <span class="kanji-inline">缺</span>, a phono‑semantic compound with <span class="kanji-inline">夬</span> as its sound and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="缶.html">缶</a>, the hotogi—an earthenware vessel used for liquids—as its meaning element. In Shirakawa’s view, <span class="kanji-inline">夬</span> originally depicts a hand taking up a ring‑shaped jade with a piece missing, a vivid image of something not whole. Because pottery chips so easily, the graph came to signify a vessel with a piece gone, and by extension the general ideas of lacking, being short of, or insufficient. By contrast, <span class="kanji-inline">欠</span> in its own right draws a person seen in profile with mouth thrust forward, the act of yawning; hence words like <span class="kanji-inline">欠</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="伸.html">伸</a>, the combined yawn and back‑stretch. Although modern usage often writes the “lack” meanings with <span class="kanji-inline">欠</span>, the yawning figure and the “chipped vessel” graph arose from different images.</p>
