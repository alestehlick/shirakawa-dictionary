    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the earliest script forms, <span class="kanji-inline">辛</span> sketches a large, handled needle—the instrument for tattooing. As the emblem of punitive tattooing, it served as a potent ritual sign: set above the graph of a covenant vessel into which written prayers were placed, it formed characters for solemn vows made before the gods. Placed on a woman’s brow it produced <span class="kanji-inline">妾</span>, originally indicating a woman consecrated as an offering. The old writing of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="罪.html">罪</a> combined <span class="kanji-inline">辛</span> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="自.html">自</a> “nose,” picturing facial tattooing as punishment and thus coming to mean “crime.” From the pain and severity of tattooing, <span class="kanji-inline">辛</span> came to express “hard, severe,” and by extension in taste, “spicy, pungent, even salty.” It is also the eighth of the Ten Heavenly Stems (kanoto).</p>
