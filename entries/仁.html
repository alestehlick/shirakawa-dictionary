    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">仁</span> as a compound built from the person graph (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="人.html">人</a>) set over a small two-stroke element that originally depicted a mat. In early forms, it shows a person seated on a warm mat, an image that evokes gentle warmth and composure. From this picture arose senses such as being warmhearted and calming, which naturally broadened into tenderness and mercy. Over time, this concrete image of a warmed, composed person was abstracted into the high ideal of benevolence that Confucianism calls ren.</p>
