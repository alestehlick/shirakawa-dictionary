    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a>, which speaks of a house or lineage, and the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="伐.html">伐</a> (batsu). In early military usage, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="伐.html">伐</a> in phrases such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="伐.html">伐</a><span class="kanji-inline">旌</span> referred to the public recognition and awarding of martial exploits. An older related form, written with a graph akin to <span class="kanji-inline">蔑</span>, evoked the ritual capture and killing of enemy priestesses to dispel their curse power—hence that graph’s later sense of “to despise.” In <span class="kanji-inline">閥</span>, however, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="伐.html">伐</a> contributes its sound and the notion of “merit, exploit,” while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a> anchors the meaning in “house” and “lineage.” The character thus came to denote a house distinguished by military merit—renowned lineage, a powerful family—and by extension the circles of influence known as cliques or factions, as in monbatsu, gakubatsu, zaibatsu, and habatsu.</p>
