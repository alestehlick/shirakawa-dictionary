    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">旬</span> is a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">勹</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>. In oracle-bone and bronze forms, the core element is a dragon with its tail coiled; this coiled-tail sign alone marked a span of ten days. The shape echoes <span class="kanji-inline">云</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="雲.html">雲</a>) “cloud,” which in archaic writing shows the dragon’s rolled tail just visible beneath the clouds. The ten-day unit was pictured with a dragon because a dragon-form deity was thought to govern the fortunes of each such cycle. In the Yin (Shang) calendar a <span class="kanji-inline">旬</span> was ten days; later, adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a> made its time value explicit and yielded the present form <span class="kanji-inline">旬</span>. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">旬</span> came to mean a ten-day period and, by extension, the timely “in-season” moment. Because a <span class="kanji-inline">旬</span> is something that turns in steady succession, the related graph <span class="kanji-inline">徇</span> carries the sense of revolving in sequence.</p>
