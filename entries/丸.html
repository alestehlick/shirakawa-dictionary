    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">丸</span> as a pictograph of a rounded missile set against a bowstring, ready to be loosed. From this image—the compact, drawn projectile once associated with the spring bow—the character naturally came to signify the very quality of roundness and, by extension, small round things. Hence its use for items shaped into pellets, as in pills (<span class="kanji-inline">丸</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="薬.html">薬</a>), and for motions that evoke rolling over and over (<span class="kanji-inline">丸</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="転.html">転</a>). In older usage,<span class="kanji-inline">弾</span><span class="kanji-inline">丸</span> named the bow’s projectile and later came to mean a bullet, but the core idea remains the same: the succinct, complete, rounded form captured in everyday Japanese uses like maru and marui.</p>
