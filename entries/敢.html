    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">敢</span> depicts a ritual scene: fragrant wine is ladled with a shaku to purify the worship site as the gods are formally invited. Because this invitation rite is conducted with care and reverence, the character first conveys acting with restraint and respect. A related sacred setting is evoked in <span class="kanji-inline">嚴</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">厳</span>), where two covenant vessels (sai) holding written prayers are placed at a rocky dwelling of the gods—an act carried out with awe-filled deliberation. From this atmosphere of solemn, intentional performance, <span class="kanji-inline">敢</span> came to express venturing to act—boldly, and with resolve.</p>
