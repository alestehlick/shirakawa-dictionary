    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a straightforward pictograph of a horse, drawn with its distinctive mane to make the animal unmistakable. From its earliest forms, it simply names the horse. In the vast reaches of ancient China, horses were indispensable for transport, and carriages appeared early; they were later harnessed as war chariots. The carriage-and-horse pits found in Shang royal tombs, where horses and vehicles were interred together, testify to the animal’s central place in life, ritual, and power.</p>
