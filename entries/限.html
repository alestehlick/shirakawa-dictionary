    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Limits are pictured here through a sacred threshold. The left element <span class="kanji-inline">阝</span> (from <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span>) originally depicts the ladder by which deities ascend and descend between heaven and earth—a holy place that must be protected. At that approach an apotropaic eye <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="目.html">目</a>, a curse eye set to repel evil, is installed, and beneath it stands <span class="kanji-inline">匕</span>, the figure of a person turning away. The whole character thus shows someone forced to turn back under the warding eye at the divine approach, where further advance is barred. From this image comes the sense of setting bounds and not permitting passage—hence “to limit” and “limit.”</p>
