    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa traces <span class="kanji-inline">療</span> to a ritual origin. The element <span class="kanji-inline">樂</span> was once the shape of a handled handbell, and in the old character <span class="kanji-inline">藥</span> it evoked a shamanic miko ringing that bell to drive away the demon of illness—hence the senses “heal” and “cure.” As the explicit exorcistic image receded, the graph was regularized as a phonetic–semantic form: the sickness radical <span class="kanji-inline">疒</span> marks the field of illness, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寮.html">寮</a> functions as the phonetic, pointing to the on reading ryo. In this way the character came to signify treatment and healing.</p>
