    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">短</span> is a phono-semantic character that combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="矢.html">矢</a>, an arrow, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="豆.html">豆</a> as its phonetic element. The Shuowen remarks that when something is too long or too short, it is corrected using an arrow—evoking the arrow as a tool for gauging and adjusting length. The element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="豆.html">豆</a> originally depicts a high-footed vessel with a short neck, further reinforcing the notion of shortness. From this pairing, the character first signified a short arrow and then broadened to mean simply ‘short’ or ‘low.’ By extension it came to express falling behind or being inferior, and in reference to a person’s defects, it could also mean to point out or speak ill of their shortcomings.</p>
