    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">恒</span> as a phono‑semantic character: <span class="kanji-inline">亘</span> serves as the phonetic, signaling the On reading kō, while the original graph pictured a crescent moon set between two horizontal lines. The bow‑like crescent steadily advancing toward fullness echoes a line in the Book of Odes (Minor Odes, Tian Bao): “as the moon is constant,” likening the arc to a drawn bow. A moon goddess called Heng E was associated with this recurring cycle of waxing and waning that never vanishes, reinforcing the sense of what endures without interruption. From this imagery the character came to express tsune, what is abiding and reliable, and by extension hisashii, long‑continued.</p>
