    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the phonetic element read kaku shows a frame (<span class="kanji-inline">冂</span>) set over a bird about to take flight, conveying the idea of holding something back firmly. When this is combined with the semantic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="石.html">石</a> “stone,” it adds the sense of hardness—something pressed, strengthened, or beaten solid with a stone becomes firm and steady. From this come the meanings “hard, firm,” and by extension “reliable, certain.” In Japanese it appears as tashika “certain” and the verb tashikameru “to make sure, to ascertain,” as in confirming the authenticity of something.</p>
