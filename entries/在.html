    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa takes <span class="kanji-inline">在</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a>. In early forms, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a> depicts a landmark post set up to mark and sanctify a spot: a vertical stake with a horizontal plate, to which a sacred receptacle for covenant texts is affixed, making the place a dwelling of the divine and thus a place that truly “is.” To this, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="士.html">士</a>—understood as the head of a small broadax—was added as a ritual implement that protects the signpost and affirms the reality of that sanctified presence. From this sense of “being” under the authority of a sacred site, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a> stands as the prototype of <span class="kanji-inline">在</span>, which first meant “to be, to exist” in a sacral context, then generalized to “to be” for things, and for people took the form oru, “to be present.” Relatedly, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="存.html">存</a>, formed by adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a> “child” to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="才.html">才</a>, expresses the child’s life and continued existence being secured through that same act of sanctification.</p>
