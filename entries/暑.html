    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">暑</span> as a phono-semantic compound: the upper <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a> is the sun, the source of scorching light, while the lower element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a> serves as the sound carrier. In archaic forms, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a> depicts a talismanic tablet set into the earthen wall encircling a village as a protective charm, and here it lends its voice value. With the sun above, the character comes to mean the state of being baked by sunlight—hot, sultry weather. As a phonetic, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="庶.html">庶</a> (sho), associated with cooking and heat, would suit the reading even better, and because <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="庶.html">庶</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a> were close in sound, early forms could use them in place of each other; but the core sense rests on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>, the heat of the sun.</p>
