    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">警</span> as a picto-phonetic graph built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="敬.html">敬</a>, which supplies the on reading kei and the core image. In early ritual scenes evoked by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="敬.html">敬</a>, a Qiang person is forced to kneel before a sai, a covenant vessel that holds written petitions to the gods; he is struck as prayers are uttered—an admonitory rite meant to compel and warn. With the speech element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> added, <span class="kanji-inline">警</span> comes to mean admonition expressed in words—speaking to warn. From there the sense broadens to being cautious or refraining, and further to making ready and providing.</p>
