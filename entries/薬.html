    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the grass radical signals medicinal herbs, while the inner element <span class="kanji-inline">樂</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="楽.html">楽</a>) serves as the sound marker, yielding the on reading yaku. Shirakawa notes that this sound reflects an older value that shifted in the same way seen when <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勺.html">勺</a> “shaku” becomes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="約.html">約</a> “yaku” and <span class="kanji-inline">釋</span> “shaku” becomes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="訳.html">訳</a> “yaku”; related graphs like <span class="kanji-inline">鑠</span> also preserve the older shaku. The Shuowen defines it as “grass that cures illness,” hence its core senses of medicine and healing by medicine. Shirakawa further interprets <span class="kanji-inline">樂</span> as the form of a handbell with a handle, and sees the ancient image behind <span class="kanji-inline">薬</span> as a shamaness ringing that bell to drive out the spirits of disease—an origin that explains both its herbal component and its reading as a vestige of the era when shamans were the healers.</p>
