    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">釣</span> is a phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勺.html">勺</a> as its phonetic core. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勺.html">勺</a> originally depicts a ladle or dipper, and Shirakawa traces it further back to <span class="kanji-inline">刁</span>, whose curved outline sketches a fishhook. The Yu Pian (Jade Book) already glosses the word as “to angle for fish,” and in use it straightforwardly means tsuru/tsuri, “to fish, angling.” By figurative extension, as in <span class="kanji-inline">釣</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="名.html">名</a> (“to angle for a name,” i.e., to seek fame), it also expresses the idea of seeking, requesting, or pursuing something. The Book of Odes includes songs about catching fish that are celebratory or amorous, where fish often stand as a metaphor for women. Relatedly, <span class="kanji-inline">鰥</span> “widower” combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="魚.html">魚</a> with <span class="kanji-inline">眾</span> (understood here as the form of tears), picturing one who “weeps for the fish,” that is, an old man bereft of his wife.</p>
