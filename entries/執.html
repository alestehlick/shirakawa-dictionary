    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幸.html">幸</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丸.html">丸</a>. In ancient forms, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幸.html">幸</a> depicted the manacles that fasten both hands, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丸.html">丸</a> showed the two hands stretched out. Joined together they portray hands bound with shackles—an instrument of punishment—giving the sense of seizing or arresting a culprit. From this core idea it broadened to mean catching or taking hold, and further to taking something in hand. In compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">執</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">執</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="務.html">務</a> it naturally extends to the sense of carrying out, conducting, or performing duties and ceremonies.</p>
