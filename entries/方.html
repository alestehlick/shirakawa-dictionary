    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa understands <span class="kanji-inline">方</span> as a pictograph of a dead person suspended from a horizontal beam. Such figures were erected at border places as curse-barriers to ward off evil spirits, so the graph first evoked the outer, distant regions (totsukuni) and then naturally came to mean a direction (as in hôi, hôgaku, hôkô). From the sense of a course one follows it further developed the meanings of way and method (as in hôhô). This ritual background also clarifies related graphs: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="放.html">放</a> initially referred to beating the suspended figure to drive away malign forces; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="白.html">白</a> depicts a skull; and <span class="kanji-inline">敫</span> shows a skull hung up and struck on a post in an exorcistic rite.</p>
