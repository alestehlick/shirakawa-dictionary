    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">導</span> as a picto‑phonetic graph with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="道.html">道</a> (dō) providing the sound. In bronze inscriptions the graph written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="道.html">道</a> combined <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="首.html">首</a> “head,” the movement element <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a> “hand”; that composite is the ancestor of <span class="kanji-inline">導</span>. Here <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> marks advancing, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>—and later <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a>, which also signified the hand—shows the hand at work. The scene depicts grasping the head of someone from another tribe while entering foreign territory, proceeding with exorcistic, purifying power to clear malign influences. From this rite, <span class="kanji-inline">導</span> came to mean the purified, exorcised way and, by extension, to lead or guide, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="道.html">道</a> settled into the sense of “road, way.” The term <span class="kanji-inline">導</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="引.html">引</a>, noted in the Shuowen, names a Daoist breath-guiding practice for prolonging life.</p>
