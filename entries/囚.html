    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">囚</span> as a compound of the enclosure frame <span class="kanji-inline">囗</span> and the human figure <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="人.html">人</a>, a picture of a person shut within a fence. From this image come the senses “to capture,” “to be captured,” and, by extension, “a prisoner.” In classical usage <span class="kanji-inline">囚</span> especially denoted captives taken in war, and compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">囚</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="人.html">人</a> (prisoner) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="拘.html">拘</a><span class="kanji-inline">囚</span> (to be arrested and confined) preserve the core idea of being held within bounds. In antiquity, confinement often meant caves or sunken chambers called <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="深.html">深</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="室.html">室</a> (“deep rooms”) or earthen circular pens known as <span class="kanji-inline">圜</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a>, vividly echoing the graph’s original scene of enclosure.</p>
