    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">坂</span> takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="反.html">反</a> as its phonetic, indicating the on reading han. In archaic form <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="反.html">反</a> depicts a hand (mata) braced against a cliff-like face (the form of a cliff), poised to claw upward; from this image, <span class="kanji-inline">坂</span> came to name terrain shaped like such a face—hence a slope or hill. Expressions such as sakamichi (a road formed by a slope) and kyuhan (a steep incline) preserve this sense. The Shuowen records the older graph <span class="kanji-inline">阪</span>, explaining it as something steep and as valleys or barriers—that is, slopes and banks. The original form of <span class="kanji-inline">阪</span> is linked to the “gods’ ladder,” the device by which deities ascend and descend between heaven and earth, suggesting a ceremonial incline set up at sacred places. <span class="kanji-inline">坂</span> does not appear in the Shuowen; <span class="kanji-inline">阪</span> is the original character, with <span class="kanji-inline">坂</span> created later, and in Japan <span class="kanji-inline">坂</span> became the commonly used form.</p>
