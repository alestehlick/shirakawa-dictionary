    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">郭</span> is a phono-semantic character that grew out of a plan view of a fortress: walls enclosing a space, with watchtowers thrust out to look far into the distance. That pictorial form was later streamlined into <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="享.html">享</a>, which became the phonetic element, and joined with <span class="kanji-inline">邑</span>, the city/place sign, to yield the present character. The image is of a settlement ringed on all four sides by ramparts with projecting towers at the cardinal points, so the word comes to mean the encircling walls of a city and, by extension, any enclosure whose interior is left open.</p>
