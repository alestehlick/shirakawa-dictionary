    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">意</span> is a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">音</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">心</span>. In early ritual practice, petitioners placed <span class="kanji-inline">言</span>—solemn prayer texts—before the altar; Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">言</span> as the tattooing needle <span class="kanji-inline">辛</span> set above a covenant vessel, a form that marks an oath whose falsity invites punishment, hence “words” addressed to the gods. The deity’s answer came as faint sounds in the night (<span class="kanji-inline">音</span>), which the human heart (<span class="kanji-inline">心</span>) listened to and inferred. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">意</span> originally means to weigh and divine the gods’ intention—to make an inference from sacred sounds. From this root it broadened to “think,” to fix one’s will, and to denote the heart/mind itself. Related graphs preserve the nuance of surmise: <span class="kanji-inline">憶</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">憶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="度.html">度</a> convey conjecture, <span class="kanji-inline">臆</span> a fearful kind of guessing, and <span class="kanji-inline">噫</span> the exclamation uttered when one is moved by a deity’s prompting.</p>
