    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">擔</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the hand element signals a manual action, while <span class="kanji-inline">詹</span> supplies the sound tan. The Shuowen glosses the related form <span class="kanji-inline">儋</span> as “to bear on the shoulder.” In later usage <span class="kanji-inline">擔</span> became the standard full form, and <span class="kanji-inline">担</span> is its abbreviated shape. The graph as a whole evokes shouldering a load—carrying or bearing it, even on one’s back.</p>
