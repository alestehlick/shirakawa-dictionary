    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the phonetic is <span class="kanji-inline">辰</span> (read shin), which was originally the graph later used as <span class="kanji-inline">蜃</span>, depicting a clam-like creature with its limbs thrust out, suggestive of a piece of flesh in motion. To this is added the “sai,” a ritual receptacle for depositing written prayers to the deities, pointing to the act of divination. By analogy with the older body-part form <span class="kanji-inline">脣</span>, which employs the flesh radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a>, this graph came to be used for kuchibiru, the lips.</p>
