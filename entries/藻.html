    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">藻</span> is a phono-semantic character: the grass radical marks it as a plant. Its phonetic element is given as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="果.html">果</a>, while the Shuowen cites <span class="kanji-inline">巢</span>; both portray things massed on a tree—either many small receptacles for prayer writings hung up and offered with clamor, or the heads of nestlings aligned in a tree nest—so they carry the sense of “many” gathered together. From this image of dense covering, the character came to name mo, the water plants that spread across a water’s surface. Admiring the beauty of those patterns, it further came to mean decorative design and elegant rhetorical ornament, as seen in words like <span class="kanji-inline">藻</span><span class="kanji-inline">麗</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="文.html">文</a><span class="kanji-inline">藻</span>.</p>
