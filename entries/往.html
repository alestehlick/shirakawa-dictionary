    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">往</span> is a picto‑phonetic graph: on the left is <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, the sign of walking, and on the right a component formed by placing the footprint sign <span class="kanji-inline">之</span> atop <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="王.html">王</a>, the head of the ceremonial broadax that symbolized royal authority. Before departing on the king’s command, one would ritually set one’s feet upon this sacred axe to take on its numinous power; accordingly that right-hand element itself conveyed “to go” and also served as the phonetic. Combined with <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, it yields the meaning “to go, to set out.” This idea of going was later extended to time, giving the sense “the past.”</p>
