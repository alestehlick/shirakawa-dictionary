    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, originally written <span class="kanji-inline">拔</span>. The hand radical signals a manual act, while the accompanying element (given here as <span class="kanji-inline">灰</span>), which bears the on reading hatsu and is associated with hair, suggests what is being grasped; together they depict pulling hair out by hand, hence the core meaning “to draw out.” Early lexica gloss it as drawing or bringing forth, and from that sense arise extensions such as selecting and advancing someone from among many (<span class="kanji-inline">抜</span><span class="kanji-inline">擢</span>), removing or eliminating (<span class="kanji-inline">拔</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="除.html">除</a>), excelling beyond the mass (<span class="kanji-inline">抜</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="群.html">群</a>), excerpting selected passages (<span class="kanji-inline">抜</span><span class="kanji-inline">粋</span>・<span class="kanji-inline">抜</span><span class="kanji-inline">萃</span>), and removing a cause at its root (<span class="kanji-inline">抜</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="本.html">本</a>).</p>
