    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound character that joins <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="古.html">古</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>. In Shirakawa’s view, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="古.html">古</a> shows a sacred shield (kan/tate) set upon a covenant vessel (sai) that held written prayers, expressing the long preservation of their efficacy. With the addition of <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>, the hand that strikes, the graph comes to depict an act that strikes against and thus intentionally undermines that preserved efficacy. From this arise senses like “deliberately” (kotosara) and the notion of an adverse occurrence seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="事.html">事</a><span class="kanji-inline">故</span>. Through association with yue “reason,” <span class="kanji-inline">故</span> also denotes the grounds or justification for something, while continuing to carry older nuances such as “old” and “former.”</p>
