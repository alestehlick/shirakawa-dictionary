    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character built with <span class="kanji-inline">洛</span> as its phonetic, giving the on-yomi raku. Within <span class="kanji-inline">洛</span>, the element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="各.html">各</a> conveys the idea of something descending from above. Ancient glosses distinguish <span class="kanji-inline">零</span> for what falls from the sky—rain or dew—and <span class="kanji-inline">落</span> for what falls from trees—leaves; from there, the character broadened to the general senses “to fall,” “to come down,” and even “to stop, cease.” In ritual usage, <span class="kanji-inline">落</span> also refers to the blood-purification performed when a building or vessel is completed. Paired with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="成.html">成</a>, which denotes fixing a final ornament and purifying when the forging of a pike is finished, the compound <span class="kanji-inline">落</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="成.html">成</a> came to mean the ceremonial completion of construction.</p>
