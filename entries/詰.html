    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">詰</span> joins the speech element <span class="kanji-inline">言</span> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="吉.html">吉</a> as its phonetic and guiding idea. In Shirakawa’s reading, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="吉.html">吉</a> shows a sacred axe set upon a covenant vessel (sai) that held written prayers, an image of sealing and preserving the efficacy of a petition. From this ritual act comes the sense of packing or filling something tight, and, by extension, of pressing for a result. When paired with <span class="kanji-inline">言</span>, the character depicts pressing someone with words—crowding them verbally—so it comes to mean to cram, to demand an answer, to question closely, and to reproach or scold.</p>
