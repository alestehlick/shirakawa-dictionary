    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">鐘</span> is a phono-semantic compound: the metal element indicates a crafted object of metal, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="童.html">童</a> functions as the phonetic, pointing to the on reading shou, as seen as well in <span class="kanji-inline">憧</span>. The character names the bell, notably the great hanging temple bell. The Shuowen explains it as a music bell, sounded in divine rites and in banquet halls. In early usage it referred to fairly large bells, several tens of centimeters in length, used for festival worship; later, musicians assembled sets of small and large bells—often eight, fourteen, or sixteen—as a tuned instrument, striking them in sequence to produce the musical scale.</p>
