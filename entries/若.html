    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa understands <span class="kanji-inline">若</span> as a pictograph of a female shaman: her long hair streaming, both hands raised as she dances and prays to solicit a divine oracle. A ritual “sai” vessel was added—into which prayer texts were later placed—signaling formal chanting and petition; in the modern form, the once upraised hands have been simplified into the grass-like crown at the top. The character thus shows a medium possessed by the deity and entrusted to relay the heavenly will, which underlies uses where <span class="kanji-inline">若</span> expresses “as is/as if,” the faithful conveying of a message, and by extension the idea of “following” that will. Because such deity-servants were young, the graph also came to mean “young.” In classical texts it can substitute for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="如.html">如</a>, or <span class="kanji-inline">而</span> and serves for meanings such as “if,” “or,” and even the second-person “you.” The related <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="如.html">如</a>, built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a> with a chanting sign, depicts the same praying posture and closely parallels <span class="kanji-inline">若</span> in structure.</p>
