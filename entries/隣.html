    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Bronze inscriptions already show <span class="kanji-inline">隣</span> as a compound of the left-hand boundary/ladder element and the right-hand <span class="kanji-inline">粦</span>. In <span class="kanji-inline">粦</span>, a large human figure (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>) is set over splayed legs (<span class="kanji-inline">舛</span>), with dots marking fresh blood, depicting a crucified victim offered in sacrifice; by extension it evoked the eerie corpse-fire (onibi) that was believed to arise there. The left element is understood as the gods’ ladder by which deities ascend and descend. Placing a human offering before this divine ladder and letting the death-fire burn created a potent curse-barrier at the frontier with other tribes. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">隣</span> originally named a sacred boundary site guarded by such interdiction, and only later came to mean a neighboring place or being side by side. In this view, <span class="kanji-inline">隣</span> preserves the older form, while <span class="kanji-inline">鄰</span> is a later reshaping; adding the fire radical to <span class="kanji-inline">粦</span> gives <span class="kanji-inline">燐</span>, the graph for the corpse-light.</p>
