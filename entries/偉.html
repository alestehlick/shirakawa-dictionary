    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">偉</span> places the person element beside <span class="kanji-inline">韋</span>, which serves as the phonetic and supplies the On reading i. In this phonetic series, <span class="kanji-inline">韋</span> carries a positive charge—connotations of excellence and goodness—clearly echoed by related graphs like <span class="kanji-inline">韙</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">韡</span> that evoke beauty, prosperity, and vigor. Although <span class="kanji-inline">韋</span> also belongs to a graphic lineage tied to animal hide or leather, <span class="kanji-inline">偉</span> shares that family background while turning the sense toward human qualities: it describes a person of outstanding stature, someone who excels and is admirable, as seen in compounds for eminent talent, great person, and imposing presence.</p>
