    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the oracle-bone and bronze forms, this character drew the tied ends of a thread, a compact image of completion. Later an ice element was added to that figure, yielding the present form <span class="kanji-inline">冬</span>. By phonetic loan it came to serve as the name of the season, winter. To state the sense of “ending” more explicitly, the silk/thread classifier was attached to this original image to form <span class="kanji-inline">終</span>. Thus the modern ‘winter’ graph preserves the ancient picture that underlies <span class="kanji-inline">終</span>.</p>
