    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>An indicative character that depicts two calculation rods laid side by side, as used in ancient reckoning. In oracle-bone inscriptions, the numerals from one to four are written as simple rows of such rods, and this graph marks the pair. From the image of two set together it can also suggest repetition—“again”—or things arranged in parallel, “to stand in a row.” Because its simple form is easy to alter with an extra stroke, formal writing sometimes uses the more complex form <span class="kanji-inline">貳</span> in its place to prevent tampering.</p>
