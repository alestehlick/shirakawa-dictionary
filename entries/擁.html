    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">擁</span> is a phono-semantic character built on <span class="kanji-inline">雍</span> as its phonetic core. In old forms, <span class="kanji-inline">雍</span> depicts a falconer pressing a bird to his chest—a vivid image of cradling and control. With the addition of the hand element, the graph becomes <span class="kanji-inline">擁</span>, concretely expressing the act of taking something in the arms. From this, it naturally means to hold and embrace, and by extension to protect by keeping close. The Shuowen already glosses it as “to embrace,” in harmony with this image-based origin.</p>
