    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the water sign shows the field of meaning, while the element <span class="kanji-inline">蜀</span> serves as the sound, pointing to the Sino-Japanese reading daku. Other graphs built on <span class="kanji-inline">蜀</span>, such as <span class="kanji-inline">鐲</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="濯.html">濯</a>, confirm this phonetic value across the family. Early lexica like the Shuowen and the Yupian record it as the name of a river and further gloss it as “not pure.” From the image of water that grows murky, the character comes to mean to become muddy or impure, and by extension to be defiled or fall into disorder.</p>
