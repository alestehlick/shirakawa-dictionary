    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">涼</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water element gives the semantic field, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="京.html">京</a> serves as the phonetic, guiding the on-yomi ryo. Early lexicographic glosses describe it as “thin” or “light” in taste, and ritual commentary explains ryō as diluting wine with water. From this sense of lightness and dilution comes the familiar idea of coolness—hence expressions like ryofu (cool wind) and seiryo (clear and refreshing). By further extension it can evoke the thinned, quiet atmosphere of a place emptied of heat and bustle, yielding the sense of loneliness or desolation seen in words such as koryo and hiryo. In Japanese it lives in suzushii and the verb suzumu, as in enjoying the evening cool.</p>
