    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a person shown in profile with conspicuously long hair. From the image of that length of hair it came to express length and extension—hence meanings such as “long,” “length,” and by extension “height.” Because the long-haired figure evoked an elder, one who was revered and looked to as the head of a group, the graph also developed the sense of a chief or leader and the respectful nuance attached to seniority. These associations remain visible in compounds like choja (a person of eminent virtue, also an elder or wealthy man), chojo (a superior), choro (a respected elder), kaicho (the head of an assembly), and shacho (a company’s president).</p>
