    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines the form of a broadaxe head with the hand <span class="kanji-inline">又</span>. The axe here is not a woodcutter’s tool but a ceremonial broadaxe, an emblem of command. The graph shows a hand gripping the axe-head, and so depicts a person vested with authority. From this, it came to mean the father—the one who directs the household—and, by extension, a respectful title for a distinguished man, as when Duke Ai mourned Confucius as “Ni-fu” (Father Ni) in Zuo’s Commentary. Related signs share this axe symbolism: <span class="kanji-inline">王</span> portrays a large broadaxe set down as a royal insignia, and <span class="kanji-inline">士</span> a smaller axe head for a warrior’s rank. In this system, <span class="kanji-inline">斧</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">鉞</span> mark status, and <span class="kanji-inline">斤</span> is the axe borne by the figure represented in <span class="kanji-inline">父</span>.</p>
