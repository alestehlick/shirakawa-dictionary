    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a picto-phonetic graph whose original form was written <span class="kanji-inline">號</span>, with <span class="kanji-inline">号</span> as its core. In that core, a mouth (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>) is set above a ritual container (the covenant receptacle in which written prayers were placed), and beneath it a branch-shaped element—the same idea later seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="可.html">可</a>—depicts the twig used to strike the vessel. In rites one would beat the receptacle with the branch while crying out, wailing, and pressing one’s plea to the gods; from this practice <span class="kanji-inline">号</span> took on the sense of crying and weeping. When the tiger component <span class="kanji-inline">虎</span> was added, the force of that cry was likened to a tiger’s roar, yielding <span class="kanji-inline">號</span> and supporting the on reading gō.</p>
