    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A late phono-semantic formation, <span class="kanji-inline">拐</span> pairs the hand radical with a phonetic element associated with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="掛.html">掛</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">卦</span>, which underlies its on reading kai. It does not appear in the oldest dictionaries and seems to have been coined after the Tang period. The character took hold in compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="誘.html">誘</a><span class="kanji-inline">拐</span>, “to lure and carry someone away.” A vivid historical image preserves its core sense: in the Song era, Yue Fei was said to charge enemy lines using three horses bound together with reed rope, a formation called <span class="kanji-inline">拐</span><span class="kanji-inline">子</span><span class="kanji-inline">馬</span>, the “abductor horse,” evoking the act of taking or drawing something along. From this basic idea of carrying off, the usage broadened to include deceiving or swindling.</p>
