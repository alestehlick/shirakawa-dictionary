    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">誕</span> is a phono-semantic character: the left side <span class="kanji-inline">言</span> signals speech, while the right side <span class="kanji-inline">延</span> serves as the phonetic, yielding the reading tan and the sense of something extended or drawn out. In archaic usage, as noted in the Shuowen, it meant “many words”—speech spun out grandly or beyond the facts—hence the nuances of exaggeration and deceit seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">虚</span><span class="kanji-inline">誕</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">妄</span><span class="kanji-inline">誕</span>. Its connection with birth in modern compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">誕</span><span class="kanji-inline">生</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">生</span><span class="kanji-inline">誕</span> does not stem from the original sense of the graph, but from the classical context of the Book of Odes (Major Odes, “Sheng Min”), where the line <span class="kanji-inline">誕</span><span class="kanji-inline">彌</span><span class="kanji-inline">厥</span><span class="kanji-inline">月</span>，<span class="kanji-inline">先</span><span class="kanji-inline">生</span><span class="kanji-inline">如</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="達.html">達</a> describes a woman whose months are fulfilled and who gives birth gently, “like a lamb.” From that revered verse, <span class="kanji-inline">誕</span> came to be used in expressions relating to birth.</p>
