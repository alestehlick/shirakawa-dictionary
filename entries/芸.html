    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its oldest forms the character shows a young sapling held with both hands and set into the soil: one form depicts the sapling being offered in both hands, another shows it being planted in the earth. This core element, later written as the component <span class="kanji-inline">埶</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="執.html">執</a>, thus expresses the act of planting. Because the meaning pertains to vegetation, the grass radical was attached to form <span class="kanji-inline">蓺</span>, and with the later addition of <span class="kanji-inline">云</span> the graph became <span class="kanji-inline">藝</span>. Modern Japanese simplifies the planting component, yielding <span class="kanji-inline">芸</span>, a shape that can resemble another graph meaning to weed. From the image of carefully planting and cultivating, the sense broadened to cultivated skill—hence art, craft, and accomplishment, as seen in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="技.html">技</a><span class="kanji-inline">芸</span>.</p>
