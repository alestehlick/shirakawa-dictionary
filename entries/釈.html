    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">釋</span>, the character combines <span class="kanji-inline">釆</span>, the claws of an animal, with <span class="kanji-inline">睪</span>, a figure of a dead body marked by an eye above, within which <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幸.html">幸</a> sketches the splayed limbs. It thus depicts a carcass being torn apart and scattered by claws. In contrast to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="解.html">解</a>, which shows cutting off an ox’s horns with a knife, <span class="kanji-inline">釈</span> expresses the subsequent dispersal and rending; taken together they give <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="解.html">解</a><span class="kanji-inline">釈</span>, the act of breaking things down so their meaning becomes clear. From this image the sense broadened to untying or loosening what is hard or tangled, and the graph also came to be used for ‘to discard’ (in place of <span class="kanji-inline">舎</span>) and ‘to remit’ (in place of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="赦.html">赦</a>).</p>
