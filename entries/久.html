    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a human corpse propped from behind with a stick. From that image, the act of placing the body in a wooden container yielded <span class="kanji-inline">柩</span> (wood + <span class="kanji-inline">久</span>), the word for a coffin. As a verb, <span class="kanji-inline">久</span>す meant to support or prop up. Because a corpse evoked the realm beyond, and ancient people saw the afterlife as endless in contrast to the brief span of human life, the graph came to signify long duration and even eternity (as in <span class="kanji-inline">久</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遠.html">遠</a>). A similar shift is seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="真.html">真</a>, originally depicting a person dead by the roadside, which later developed the meanings of truth and reality.</p>
