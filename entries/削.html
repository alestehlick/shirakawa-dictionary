    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肖.html">肖</a> and the knife <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a>. In Shirakawa’s view, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肖.html">肖</a> sketches a small piece of meat pierced by bone or marked with sinew. With the addition of the knife, the graph vividly captures the act of trimming flesh away, which gives rise to meanings such as shaving, paring, cutting out, and deleting. In later usage it was also borrowed for <span class="kanji-inline">鞘</span>, so it can at times denote the sheath of a knife.</p>
