    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">衡</span> is a compound graph built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="角.html">角</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a> sketches a crossing of roads; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="角.html">角</a> is an ox’s horn; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a> shows the ox’s body seen from above. In early forms the character pictures an ox on the road viewed from the front, with a squared timber laid across its shoulders—the horizontal board fixed at the tops of the cart shafts, the yoke. From this crossbar it came to mean “horizontal” and, by extension, the beam that sets left and right in comparison, hence a balance and the act of weighing. It appears in ideas of equilibrium (as in heikō, “balance”), in the weighing beam of a scale (tenbin), and in the classical triad of standards for length, capacity, and weight (doryōkō). In Japanese usage, <span class="kanji-inline">衡</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a> evokes a simple gate of two posts capped by a single transverse beam.</p>
