    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">彩</span> as a picto-phonetic character formed with <span class="kanji-inline">采</span> as its core. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">采</span>, which gives the on reading sai, depicts a hand—with the fingertips (<span class="kanji-inline">爪</span>)—reaching into a tree to pluck its seeds. From this act of taking from plants, <span class="kanji-inline">采</span> came to suggest drawing out hues, that is, coloring (irodori). To emphasize beauty, the sign <span class="kanji-inline">彡</span> is added, a mark of shimmering color and graceful form. Combined, they express irodoru: to apply color and create a lovely pattern (aya), a beautiful coloring.</p>
