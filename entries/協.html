    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its older form, <span class="kanji-inline">協</span> is built on the graph <span class="kanji-inline">劦</span>, which joins three instances of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a>. Shirakawa takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a> not as “strength,” but as the pictograph of a plough (the form of <span class="kanji-inline">耒</span>), so the three ploughs evoke people working the fields together. From this image of shared agricultural labor, the character comes to mean uniting one’s efforts—helping, coordinating, and gathering minds toward a common purpose. Hence its uses that suggest adjusting things to fit, doing something together, and even bringing plans to fruition.</p>
