    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa notes that the earliest form was written like <span class="kanji-inline">畫</span>, combining <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span>—the hand holding a brush, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a> implied—and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>, the sun. In seal script, lines were added around the sun on the right, left, and below; the element beneath the brush can be seen as <span class="kanji-inline">暈</span>, the sun’s halo. Bronze inscriptions place the sun below, so the whole graph reads as a ritual act directed toward the sun, an exorcistic rite performed in response to an extraordinary solar event. From this ritual scene the character later came to be used for the daylight hours—hiru (“noon, midday”) and hiruma (“daytime”), as in nitchu (“during the day”)—even though that everyday sense is not attested in the earliest texts.</p>
