    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">侮</span> is a phono-semantic compound: the person element on the left (<span class="kanji-inline">亻</span>) marks a human act, while <span class="kanji-inline">每</span> on the right supplies the sound and guides the sense. <span class="kanji-inline">每</span> was originally a figure of a woman with bound hair and a fixed hair ornament, and it also serves as the phonetic in characters like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="梅.html">梅</a>. Ancient glossaries gloss <span class="kanji-inline">侮</span> as to make light of, hence to despise or hold in contempt. Classical texts use it in this sense, as in the Book of Documents (Pan Geng): Do not insult the elders, and the Zuo Tradition: He did not despise the widowed.</p>
