    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">彫</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="周.html">周</a>, the image of a rectangular shield whose face is divided into four panels filled with incised designs, with <span class="kanji-inline">彡</span>, a sign that expresses beauty in color or form. Together they present the beauty of the shield’s carved patterns, and from this vivid picture the character came to mean to carve and to engrave, and by extension to decorate through carving. The older counterpart <span class="kanji-inline">雕</span>, originally depicting an eagle, was later used in place of <span class="kanji-inline">彫</span> for the same sense of carving.</p>
