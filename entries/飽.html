    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="包.html">包</a> as its phonetic. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="包.html">包</a> originally depicts a human embryo enclosed in the womb, evoking the image of a rounded, swollen belly. <span class="kanji-inline">飽</span> applies this image to the post-meal fullness of the stomach—the swelling that signals contentment—so it comes to mean being filled and sufficient, and by extension being sated and even growing tired of something once one’s fill has been reached.</p>
