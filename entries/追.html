    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound of the element written as <span class="kanji-inline">启</span> and the movement sign <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span>. The former depicts sacrificial meat (shinniku) borne and offered in rites of prayer for victory at the army shrine or ancestral mausoleum as troops prepared to depart; expeditions proceeded with this consecrated offering held aloft. With <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span>, “to walk, go,” the graph pictures advancing while bearing the sacrifice, and thus came to signify driving on in pursuit of a fleeing enemy. In later usage it broadened to the general senses of following up, catching up, and reaching.</p>
