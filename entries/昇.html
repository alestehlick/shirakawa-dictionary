    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">昇</span> as a phono-semantic graph built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="升.html">升</a>, which provides the on reading sho. In earlier usage the counterpart character <span class="kanji-inline">陞</span> appears, where the left side depicts the sacred terrace <span class="kanji-inline">阜</span>—the stepped “ladder” by which deities move between heaven and earth—set upon earthen shrine ground (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a>, the basis of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="社.html">社</a>). It thus pictures a ritual ascent to the holy place. In compounds such as shoko (“ascent and descent”), ancient texts often wrote the ascent element with <span class="kanji-inline">陞</span>. From the Han period, <span class="kanji-inline">昇</span>, formed with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a> “sun” and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="升.html">升</a>, is used especially for the rising of the sun, and later comes to be employed more generally in the sense of rising or ascending.</p>
