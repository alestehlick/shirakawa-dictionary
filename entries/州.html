    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of a sandbar set midstream: in the oldest forms, three flowing lines mark the current of a river, and an oval in their midst shows the bank of earth or sand rising above the surface. From naming such mid‑river bars and shoals, the character likely extended to the low, silt‑laden reaches of great river deltas, and thence to the idea of land itself. In antiquity the realm was divided by river systems into nine such regions, the Nine Provinces (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="九.html">九</a><span class="kanji-inline">州</span>), and later <span class="kanji-inline">州</span> became the term for an administrative unit, as in <span class="kanji-inline">州</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="県.html">県</a>. A later graphic variant, <span class="kanji-inline">洲</span>, came to specialize in the natural‑feature sense—sandbanks and, by extension, continents—while <span class="kanji-inline">州</span> remained for the administrative meaning.</p>
