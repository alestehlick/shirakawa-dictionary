    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a compound graph. In early forms it combines the sign for city walls—an enclosure—set above three human figures aligned in a row, vividly showing many people gathered within a settlement and thus giving the sense of “many.” To clarify the enclosure sign, compare <span class="kanji-inline">邑</span>, which adds the side-view of a kneeling person (<span class="kanji-inline">巴</span>) to the same walled shape to depict people within the city and so mean “capital,” “city,” or “village.” In bronze inscriptions the enclosure is sometimes written as an eye (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="目.html">目</a>), hinting at people being in view or under observation. From these images the character comes to mean a large number of people—the populace, the common folk.</p>
