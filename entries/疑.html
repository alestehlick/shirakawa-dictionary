    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa traces <span class="kanji-inline">疑</span> back to an older form written <span class="kanji-inline">矣</span>, depicting a person leaning on a cane who turns to look behind, stopping in indecision—torn between going forward or turning back. An intermediate stage adds the figure of the person turning back to <span class="kanji-inline">矣</span>, and the later graph <span class="kanji-inline">疑</span> further introduces an extra leg, sharpening the image of wavering between advance and retreat. From this picture of bewildered hesitation grew the senses of doubting and being puzzled: it began as an inward struggle over whether to proceed, and later broadened to the general idea of harboring suspicion toward others.</p>
