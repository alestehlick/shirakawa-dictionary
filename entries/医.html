    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa traces this character to a healing rite of exorcism. In its older, fuller form <span class="kanji-inline">醫</span>, the upper element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="殴.html">殴</a> is built from a sacred arrow with the power to repel malign forces and the implement for striking; it evokes beating the arrow while shouting invocations to drive out evil spirits, since illness was seen as their work. Because shamans (<span class="kanji-inline">巫</span>) performed such cures, an even earlier form combined <span class="kanji-inline">巫</span> with this striking element. As treatment later came to include purifying wounds with wine and using alcohol as a stimulant, the wine-jar sign <span class="kanji-inline">酉</span> was added beneath, yielding <span class="kanji-inline">醫</span>. The simplified form <span class="kanji-inline">医</span> condenses this history: it shows the empowered arrow set within a concealed niche, the emblem of ritual exorcism as healing—a graph already attested from very early times.</p>
