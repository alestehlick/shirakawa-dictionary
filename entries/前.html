    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the earliest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">前</span> is a compound that brings together a footprint (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a>), a shallow vessel (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舟.html">舟</a>, also written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a>) used as a basin, and a knife (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a>). It pictures washing the feet in a basin and then trimming the toenails to an even line—an act of ritual purification performed before setting out on a journey or upon returning home. From this idea of preparation prior to setting forth, the character came to mean “to advance” and “before, in front.” It also became the base for related graphs: with an added knife it formed <span class="kanji-inline">剪</span>, “to cut,” and with the hand added it gave <span class="kanji-inline">揃</span>, “to cut and set in order.” By extension, <span class="kanji-inline">前</span> naturally came to mark what is “earlier” or “formerly” in time.</p>
