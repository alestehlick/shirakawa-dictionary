    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a large rack for arranging and hanging musical instruments: a sturdy upright set on a broad base, topped with a crossbar cut with saw‑tooth notches to suspend bells and drums. Because it evoked an imposing, large‑scale implement, it underlies expressions conveying grandness. A rammer used in ancient rammed‑earth construction closely resembled this rack, and the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="撲.html">撲</a> shows two hands grasping such a device to pound. From the scene of tamping and the labor it implies, <span class="kanji-inline">業</span> shifted from the image of the instrument stand to the concrete senses of undertaking work, performing operations, and, by extension, one’s practiced skill.</p>
