    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of a sinuous, snake-bodied creature crowned with a headpiece shaped like the character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辛.html">辛</a>—a mark of a sacred beast—<span class="kanji-inline">竜</span> evokes the awe and numinous power of the dragon. In oracle-bone and bronze texts, <span class="kanji-inline">龔</span> shows a dragon (<span class="kanji-inline">竜</span>) being held up with both hands (<span class="kanji-inline">廾</span>) in offering, a graph that stands as the prototype of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="恭.html">恭</a> “to be reverent, discreet.” Dragons were associated with shamans and with rites of cursing, revered as deities of floods and appearing in old myths as gods in dragon form. Ancient graphs also preserve the dragon’s presence in nature: <span class="kanji-inline">云</span>, the ancestor of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="雲.html">雲</a> “cloud,” depicts a dragon’s coiled tail glimpsed beneath streaming clouds; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="旬.html">旬</a> shows a dragon with its tail curled; and <span class="kanji-inline">虹</span> “rainbow” pictures a creature in the shape of a dragon arcing the sky. The prevailing on-yomi is ryu (also ryo), and the character appears in expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">竜</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="頭.html">頭</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="蛇.html">蛇</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尾.html">尾</a>, “a bright beginning that dwindles at the end.”</p>
