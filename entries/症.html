    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A later phono-semantic coinage, <span class="kanji-inline">症</span> sets the sickness radical <span class="kanji-inline">疒</span> to mark the medical domain and uses <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="正.html">正</a> as the phonetic, giving the on reading sho. It names the condition or manifestations of an illness—that is, symptoms. In earlier texts this sense was expressed with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="証.html">証</a> or <span class="kanji-inline">徴</span>, characters meaning proof or sign; <span class="kanji-inline">症</span> was introduced to restrict that idea specifically to indications of disease. As a modern vulgar form, it is not attested in early literature.</p>
