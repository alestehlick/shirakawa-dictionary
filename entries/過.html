    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the phonetic is <span class="kanji-inline">咼</span> (ka), which depicts the upper part of a human skeleton (<span class="kanji-inline">冎</span>) set over a sacred container that received written petitions to the gods—an image tied to rites that purge misfortune. With <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> (“to go, walk”) added, the graph pictures moving while conducting such an exorcistic rite at the approach to a particularly important place. From this it comes to mean to pass or go beyond, and by extension to spend time. Its sense of error is connected with the idea of misfortune in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="禍.html">禍</a><span class="kanji-inline">尤</span>, where <span class="kanji-inline">尤</span> represents a sacrificial beast endowed with baleful power, hence “fault.”</p>
