    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its original form <span class="kanji-inline">黑</span>, the character combines <span class="kanji-inline">柬</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="火.html">火</a>. Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">柬</span> as the form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="東.html">東</a> understood here as a bag with something inside. The graph depicts fire applied from below so that the contents are smoked and charred, turning black or into black powder; from this concrete act arises the meaning “black.” It also evokes the method of passing things through flame to blacken them: related characters bring out different facets of the same process—<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="薫.html">薫</a> emphasizes the fragrance of the smoke, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幽.html">幽</a> shows applying fire to bundles of threads to impart a black dye. The modern form <span class="kanji-inline">黒</span> retains this sense of blackness born of smoke and charring.</p>
