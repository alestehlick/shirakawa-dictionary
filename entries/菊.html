    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">菊</span> is a phono-semantic character: the grass radical marks it as a plant, while its phonetic element supplies the sound kiku (Chinese ju). In the Shuowen it is glossed as a “great chrysanthemum,” a name that actually referred to a wild pink (Dianthus superbus); the autumn chrysanthemum proper was originally written with the graph <span class="kanji-inline">鞠</span>, which shares the same sound. In the lunar calendar the Double Ninth (the ninth day of the ninth month) became the Festival of Chrysanthemums, and the flower was revered as one that blooms in the hermits’ realm where Daoist immortals dwell. It reached Japan from China in the Nara period, came to symbolize the Sentogosho (the residence of retired emperors), and later became the crest of the Imperial house. The Japanese kiku preserves the Sino-Japanese reading unchanged.</p>
