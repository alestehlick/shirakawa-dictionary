    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">拓</span> is a phono-semantic character: the hand radical indicates action, while <span class="kanji-inline">石</span> serves as the phonetic, a role it also plays in characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">宕</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">妬</span>. In the Shuowen it is glossed as “to pick up,” and an old variant form <span class="kanji-inline">摭</span>, which uses <span class="kanji-inline">庶</span> as its phonetic, points in the same direction. <span class="kanji-inline">庶</span> originally depicts a kitchen scene with a pot, evoking the act of lifting food out—an image that underlies related graphs like <span class="kanji-inline">蹠</span>. From this core sense of picking up, the meaning broadened to opening up and developing land, as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">拓</span><span class="kanji-inline">殖</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">拓</span><span class="kanji-inline">植</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">拓</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="地.html">地</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="開.html">開</a><span class="kanji-inline">拓</span>; it later extended to the act of rubbing or pounding to take an impression, as in <span class="kanji-inline">拓</span><span class="kanji-inline">本</span>, a paper rubbing made from inscriptions carved in stone.</p>
