    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character whose original form was <span class="kanji-inline">邵</span>, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="召.html">召</a> serving as the phonetic. In <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="召.html">召</a>, Shirakawa sees a ritual scene: prayers written for the gods are placed in a covenant vessel (sai), and in answer to this offering the spirit of the deceased descends in human form. The component setsu depicts a kneeling person, so <span class="kanji-inline">邵</span> as a whole shows one bowing in reverence to welcome that descent. From this image of numinous power becoming manifest arose the senses “clear, evident,” and by extension “bright” and “to make apparent.” In bronze inscriptions the form <span class="kanji-inline">邵</span> is used; later texts came to write <span class="kanji-inline">昭</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">邵</span> fell out of use.</p>
