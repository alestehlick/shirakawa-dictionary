    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="里.html">里</a> as the phonetic element, signaling the on-yomi ri. In early usage it functioned as an abbreviated form of <span class="kanji-inline">廛</span> (also written <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="店.html">店</a>), “shop,” and later came to be used as an abbreviation for <span class="kanji-inline">釐</span> “ri,” meaning to set in order or regulate. In Japan it is read rin and denotes very small measures: one-tenth of a bu in length, one-tenth of a sen in currency, one-tenth of a monme in weight, and, in proportional expressions, one-thousandth (0.1%).</p>
