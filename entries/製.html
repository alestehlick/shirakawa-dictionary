    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats <span class="kanji-inline">製</span> as a phono-semantic character built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="制.html">制</a> as its phonetic core. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="制.html">制</a> originally evokes trimming the branches of a leafy tree with a knife—an image of cutting and arranging—which, when applied to cloth, yields the sense of cutting fabric and tailoring garments. From this base of sewing and finishing, the meaning widened to the general act of making or producing. It also extended to literary creation: in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">製</span><span class="kanji-inline">撰</span> it denotes the composing of poetry, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="御.html">御</a><span class="kanji-inline">製</span> refers to a poem or writing by the sovereign.</p>
