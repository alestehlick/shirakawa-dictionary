    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">摂</span> is a phono-semantic character. Its original form <span class="kanji-inline">攝</span> sets the hand radical beside <span class="kanji-inline">聶</span>, which supplies the sound and, in the Shuowen, is explained as “to speak softly into the ear,” suggesting an action done gently and at close range. Joined with the hand, the graph came to picture the careful drawing together of small, scattered things. This is seen in uses like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衣.html">衣</a>を<span class="kanji-inline">摂</span>る, “to arrange one’s clothing,” where a loose hem is lifted and set in order. From this core sense of gathering and setting right, the character developed meanings such as to take, to assist, to control, and to nurture or support.</p>
