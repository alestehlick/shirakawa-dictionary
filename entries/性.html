    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound, <span class="kanji-inline">性</span> pairs the heart radical <span class="kanji-inline">忄</span>, which points to feeling and sensibility, with <span class="kanji-inline">生</span> as its phonetic. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">生</span> originally depicts a sprouting plant and here lends the sound sei. From this formation, <span class="kanji-inline">性</span> came to mean the affective endowment human beings possess by birth—their innate nature or disposition. In the Warring States period it became a key term of moral thought: Mencius articulated the view that human nature is originally good, in line with Confucian teaching, while Xunzi spoke of nature as “bad” to stress the necessity of self-cultivation—an exhortation to improve oneself, not a denial that character can be corrected.</p>
