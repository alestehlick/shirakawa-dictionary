    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with the heart element indicating feelings and the graph <span class="kanji-inline">生</span>, which depicts a sprouting plant, serving as the phonetic for sei and suggesting what is inborn. Accordingly, <span class="kanji-inline">性</span> denotes the innate sensibility or feelings with which people are originally endowed—their nature, character, or what is &quot;by nature.&quot; In the Warring States period, debates on <span class="kanji-inline">性</span> (seisetsu) produced Mencius’s doctrine of innate goodness (seizensetsu) and, later, Xunzi’s doctrine of innate badness (seiakusetsu), the latter stressing the importance of self-cultivation rather than denying the possibility of moral improvement.</p>
