    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">佛</span>, this is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">弗</span> (read futsu) providing the sound. In the Shuowen it is explained as “to see indistinctly,” hence senses like faint, dim, and vague—nuances that survive in words such as <span class="kanji-inline">彷</span><span class="kanji-inline">彿</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">髣</span><span class="kanji-inline">髴</span>, which describe something that seems to appear only hazily. Later the graph was adopted to write <span class="kanji-inline">仏</span> in <span class="kanji-inline">仏</span><span class="kanji-inline">陀</span>, a phonetic rendering of the Sanskrit buddha, and so it came to mean “Buddha” and to appear in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">仏</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="教.html">教</a>. The Sanskrit buddha denotes one who has attained true enlightenment.</p>
