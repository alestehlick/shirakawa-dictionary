    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">申</span> as a pictograph of a lightning flash: a strong vertical shaft flanked by parallel streaks of light refracting to either side. Lightning was understood as a visible manifestation of divine power, so the graph originally bore the sense of “deity” and served as the ancestor of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="神.html">神</a>. Because a bolt shoots out obliquely and seems to lengthen, the graph was also linked to ideas of extending and piling up, and in later usage came to express the polite act of speaking or reporting. Once <span class="kanji-inline">申</span> took on this verbal sense, a new character for “deity,” <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="神.html">神</a>, was formed by adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a>, the altar sign used in rites, to <span class="kanji-inline">申</span>.</p>
