    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the animal sign <span class="kanji-inline">犭</span> supplies the meaning of a beast, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="苗.html">苗</a> serves as the phonetic, giving the on-reading byo. It denotes the cat. In older lore the cat was treated as a kind of tanuki, hence the synonym <span class="kanji-inline">狸</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奴.html">奴</a>. Because a cat’s pupils widen and contract strikingly with changes in light, neko no me, “cat’s eyes,” came to symbolize things that shift capriciously. The compound <span class="kanji-inline">猫</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鬼.html">鬼</a> (byoki) refers to a spell worked with a cat on the Day of the Rat in the zodiacal calendar—an echo of the uncanny aura traditionally felt around cats.</p>
