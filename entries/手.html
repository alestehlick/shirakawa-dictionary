    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of an open hand: five fingers fanning upward from the wrist. In bronze inscriptions, the ritual phrase meaning to join the hands and bow the head to the ground (baishu keishu) is at times written with head in place of hand, a variation that hints that the word represented by this graph originally referred specifically to the wrist—the point from which the spread fingers rise—before becoming the general term for the hand.</p>
