    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">亥</span> serving as the sound element that signals the on-yomi gai. The Shuowen glosses it succinctly as “a pledge in the army,” pointing to a military compact or watchword as its original sense. From that concrete setting the meaning broadened: what is formally pledged and fixed becomes what is properly furnished or endowed, and by extension what is gathered up and wrapped together—hence later nuances such as being equipped and combining or packing things into one.</p>
