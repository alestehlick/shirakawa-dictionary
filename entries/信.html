    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines the person element with speech. In early ritual script, speech depicts a formal oath to the deities, marked by placing a large tattooing needle upon a covenant vessel (sai) that held the written vow. Against this sacred backdrop, <span class="kanji-inline">信</span> names what people pledge to one another under divine sanction, hence the senses of truth and sincerity, and even the act of making something true. By extension it can mean a mark or sign, and it also serves for news or information and, by metonymy, the messenger who carries it.</p>
