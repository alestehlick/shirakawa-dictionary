    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of flowing water: three parallel strokes sketch the forceful current of a river, in contrast to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="水.html">水</a>, which depicts a smaller flow. The graph appears inside characters such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="巡.html">巡</a> (“to go around”) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="順.html">順</a> (“to follow”), reflecting the idea of moving with or along a current and linking sound and meaning in the on reading sen. The older on reading is reconstructed as thjyuen, and from this graph and its sound the kana for tsu—hiragana つ and katakana ツ—are traditionally thought to have developed.</p>
