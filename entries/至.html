    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the ancient forms, <span class="kanji-inline">至</span> depicts an inverted arrow coming to rest at a marked spot on the ground. Because the arrow was treated as a sacred implement, people would shoot it to select an auspicious patch of earth, and the place where it landed was chosen for important buildings—hence <span class="kanji-inline">至</span> appears as an element in characters like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="室.html">室</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="臺.html">臺</a>. From the image of the arrow reaching the limit of its flight, the character means “to arrive, to reach,” and by extension “the utmost, the extreme,” yielding adverbial senses such as kiwamete and hanahada, “extremely, very.”</p>
