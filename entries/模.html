    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">莫</span> as the sound element and the wood sign indicating a form made in material, <span class="kanji-inline">模</span> originally evoked a mold or pattern fashioned from wood. The Shuo Wen glosses it as “law, rule,” pointing to the idea of a normative model and giving rise to the sense seen in <span class="kanji-inline">模</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="範.html">範</a>, an exemplary standard. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="範.html">範</a> itself depicts a bamboo template that covers from above, a tangible image of a guide or mold. In the related hand-based graph the root idea is feeling one’s way by hand; from this graphic family, <span class="kanji-inline">模</span> also came to mean to take something as a pattern—to copy or follow it.</p>
