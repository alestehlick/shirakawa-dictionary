    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">旅</span> is a compound graph that brings together the image of a flagpole with a streaming banner—the clan standard—and the form <span class="kanji-inline">从</span>, depicting people aligned one behind another, the old shape of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="従.html">従</a>. The ancient figure shows a clan column advancing under its banner, and from this it came to mean setting out on a long road, hence “travel.” In clan affairs one moved with the standard held aloft; related ideas cluster around this emblem: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="族.html">族</a> evokes the rite of swearing an oath beneath the clan flag, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遊.html">遊</a> suggests raising a banner imbued with the clan’s spirit. In antiquity, a <span class="kanji-inline">旅</span> was often a purposeful journey, such as pilgrimages to worship mountain and river deities or visits to branch shrines.</p>
