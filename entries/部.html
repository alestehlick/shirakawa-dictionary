    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: the right-hand <span class="kanji-inline">邑</span> points to settlements—villages and towns—while the phonetic element evokes the idea of splitting. Shirakawa takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="音.html">音</a> to depict a ripened fruit on the verge of bursting, and notes how the same phonetic appears in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="剖.html">剖</a>, where it combines with the knife radical <span class="kanji-inline">刂</span> to mean cutting into two. In early glosses such as the Yu Pian it is simply “to divide.” From the sense of apportioning a settlement into parts, the character came to mean a divided district, one of several parts of a whole, and by extension a section or classification.</p>
