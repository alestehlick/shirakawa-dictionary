    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The earliest form is <span class="kanji-inline">搖</span>, a phono-semantic compound: the hand radical marks a manual action, while the right-hand element functions as the phonetic that gives the On reading yo. In that element, <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> (later written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a>) represents meat placed on a narrow-mouthed earthenware jar (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="缶.html">缶</a>), with the mass unsteadily bulging over the rim—an image of wobbling instability. Shuowen glosses it simply as “to move,” and from this picture of an unsteady, overflowing mass the senses “to shake,” “to sway,” and more generally “to move” naturally developed.</p>
