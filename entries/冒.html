    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its original form, <span class="kanji-inline">冒</span> combines a cap-shaped element (the headgear sign, graphically akin to <span class="kanji-inline">冃</span> and sometimes written like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a>) with the eye <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="目.html">目</a>. It pictures a deep cap pulled down so that only the eyes show, giving the sense of covering or putting something on the head. The Shuowen glosses it as “advance while covered,” evoking a warrior donning a helmet and pressing forward. From this image arises the meanings “to venture in spite of danger,” hence “to risk” and “to defy,” as reflected in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">冒</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="険.html">険</a> (to brave danger), <span class="kanji-inline">冒</span><span class="kanji-inline">死</span> (to risk death), <span class="kanji-inline">冒</span><span class="kanji-inline">瀆</span> (to profane), and <span class="kanji-inline">冒</span><span class="kanji-inline">犯</span> (to offend or violate).</p>
