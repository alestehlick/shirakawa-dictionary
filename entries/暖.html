    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: early forms appear as <span class="kanji-inline">燠</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">煖</span>, written with the fire or sun element to show heat, combined with a right-hand phonetic that marks the on-reading. Shirakawa identifies that phonetic as the frontal figure of a shaman with shorn hair—an officiant who served the gods. In times of drought and famine, rain-invoking rites included burning such shamans; paired with the fire/sun element, this ritual image yielded the sense of warmth and heat. The series used <span class="kanji-inline">燠</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">煖</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">暖</span> for related meanings such as “warm” and “to warm (up),” and in later usage the form with the sun radical, <span class="kanji-inline">暖</span>, became the standard character.</p>
