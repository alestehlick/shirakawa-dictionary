    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">禪</span>, this is a phono-semantic character with the ritual-signifier <span class="kanji-inline">礻</span> indicating a sacred rite and <span class="kanji-inline">單</span> serving as the phonetic. The Shuowen defines it as “to worship Heaven,” referring to the imperial Fengshan ceremony in which the Son of Heaven erected an altar to honor Heaven and Earth. Because that rite accompanied the formal yielding of the throne (<span class="kanji-inline">禅</span><span class="kanji-inline">譲</span>), the graph also took on the sense “to abdicate.” Later, the word named the Chan/Zen tradition (<span class="kanji-inline">禅</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="宗.html">宗</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">禅</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="学.html">学</a>), a Mahayana current transmitted from India and shaped in China in dialogue with native thought such as Zhuangzi, becoming an indigenous Chinese intellectual religion.</p>
