    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a> with an element written as <span class="kanji-inline">卯</span> (also seen as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="卵.html">卵</a>), whose ancient form depicts a puddle or water hole beside a flowing stream. Together they picture water collecting on the rice fields, and so the original sense was of water gathering and being held back—‘to pool, accumulate’—which naturally extended to ‘to stop, stay, remain.’ In later usage it came to mean simply ‘to stop’ or ‘to stay.’ The Shuowen glosses it as ‘to stop/stay,’ while the related form <span class="kanji-inline">溜</span> denotes stagnant water.</p>
