    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character. Its older form is <span class="kanji-inline">妝</span>, built with a phonetic element from <span class="kanji-inline">壯</span> (notably <span class="kanji-inline">爿</span>) that provides the reading shou. In bronze inscriptions a crooked auxiliary stroke is set beside the woman <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a>; the same stroke appears in archaic forms of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="安.html">安</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="保.html">保</a>, and is understood as the mark of special clothing worn when one is possessed by a new spirit. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">妝</span>—and by extension <span class="kanji-inline">粧</span>—originally evoked adorning oneself to welcome that spirit, taking on another persona. When the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="米.html">米</a> “rice” element was added, it pointed to rice flour and other powders used in beautifying the face, and the meaning settled on cosmetic adornment.</p>
