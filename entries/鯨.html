    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the fish radical (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="魚.html">魚</a>) signals an aquatic creature, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="京.html">京</a> serves as the phonetic, giving the on-reading gei and suggesting grandeur. Early dictionaries gloss it as “a great fish of the sea,” and the Yu Pian calls it “the king of fish,” that is, the whale. The image resonated in poetry—Du Fu writes of drinking “like a great whale drawing in a hundred rivers.” In traditional usage <span class="kanji-inline">鯨</span> could denote the male whale, with <span class="kanji-inline">鯢</span> for the female; together they appear as <span class="kanji-inline">鯨</span><span class="kanji-inline">鯢</span>.</p>
