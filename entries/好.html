    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">好</span> combines the graphs for woman (<span class="kanji-inline">女</span>) and child (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a>). In oracle-bone and bronze forms it appears as a woman cradling a child, expressing the original sense of a mother cherishing her infant. This nurturing affection is echoed in the Book of Odes, which says <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="妻.html">妻</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a><span class="kanji-inline">好</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="合.html">合</a>, “wife and children in loving harmony.” From this core idea the character came to describe what is beautiful and pleasing, what is intimate and friendly, and more broadly anything in a favorable, good state—hence its later use for liking or being fond of something.</p>
