    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">感</span> is a phono-semantic character built on the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">咸</span> (kan). In <span class="kanji-inline">咸</span>, a sacred broadax (<span class="kanji-inline">戉</span>) is set over a covenant receptacle (sai), a coffer that held written petitions to the gods, sealing and guarding the prayers within. It was believed that when prayers were thus secured, the gods would visit in secret at night to grant a response. From this scene of a divine answer—the moving of the gods’ own heart—<span class="kanji-inline">感</span> came to signify the stirring of the heart, and by extension the feelings and thoughts that arise within the human mind.</p>
