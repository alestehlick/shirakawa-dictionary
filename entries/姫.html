    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa traces the character to the older form <span class="kanji-inline">姬</span>, a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a> “woman” and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="臣.html">臣</a>, which in this context sketches the breasts. Adding this breast element to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a> portrays a woman who has reached physical maturity. In early Japanese, hime referred broadly to women as the counterpart to hiko for men, and only later narrowed to daughters of high nobility or the empress. He links this to <span class="kanji-inline">彦</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">彥</span>), where <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="文.html">文</a> denotes temporary red body painting and <span class="kanji-inline">彡</span> marks beauty, together indicating the decorative markings applied to a youth’s forehead at a coming‑of‑age rite—hence a young man who has become an adult. By parallel, <span class="kanji-inline">姫</span> likely also belonged to the sphere of female coming‑of‑age.</p>
