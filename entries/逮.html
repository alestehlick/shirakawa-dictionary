    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="隶.html">隶</a> supplies the sound tai and depicts a hand grasping the tail of a baleful animal used in cursing rites. By seizing that tail one was believed to make misfortune reach others or to avert it, which gave the character the senses of “to reach, extend to” and “to bring upon, affect,” as in <span class="kanji-inline">逮</span><span class="kanji-inline">及</span>. In later usage it also came to mean “to seize, arrest,” as in <span class="kanji-inline">逮</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="捕.html">捕</a>.</p>
