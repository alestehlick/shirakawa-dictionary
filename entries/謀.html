    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound with <span class="kanji-inline">言</span> “words” and the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="某.html">某</a>. In its original form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="某.html">某</a> combines a sign shaped like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>—here not the sun, but the image of a ritual receptacle holding a written prayer—with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>, a twig, evoking the act of attaching that prayer slip to a branch and offering it to the gods to seek their will. Built on this base, <span class="kanji-inline">謀</span> names words uttered in such seeking or intending: first the consultation of divine counsel, then more broadly planning and scheming, and by extension even deception. The compound <span class="kanji-inline">咨</span><span class="kanji-inline">謀</span> preserves this early nuance of inquiry to the gods; <span class="kanji-inline">咨</span> itself means to intone a prayer or lament, and as a verb signifies consulting the deities.</p>
