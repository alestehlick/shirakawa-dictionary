    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">賊</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">鼎</span>, the bronze tripod on which solemn covenants were engraved, and <span class="kanji-inline">戎</span>, “arms,” which itself combines a pike (<span class="kanji-inline">戈</span>) and a shield (<span class="kanji-inline">干</span>) to signify weaponry and war. In ancient practice, to gouge out, erase, or deface the inscriptions on a tripod with weapons was to violate the vow. From this image, <span class="kanji-inline">賊</span> comes to mean harming or breaking what should be kept, and by extension an offender or scoundrel. In the same vein, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="盗.html">盗</a> evokes betrayal of a blood oath, so <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="盗.html">盗</a><span class="kanji-inline">賊</span> originally referred to one who violates sacred pledges—a criminal against society—before later narrowing to the sense of a robber.</p>
