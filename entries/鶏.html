    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">鷄</span>, this is a phono-semantic graph: <span class="kanji-inline">奚</span> serves as the phonetic, signaling the on reading kei and echoing the bird’s cry. The Shuowen designates <span class="kanji-inline">雞</span> as the orthodox form, treating it as the Zhou-style counterpart of <span class="kanji-inline">鷄</span>. Oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions already depict a rooster with comb and sweeping tail, a silhouette reminiscent of the august phoenix <span class="kanji-inline">鳳</span>, suggesting the cock was once regarded as a sacred bird. When a bird belonged to mythic, sacred lore, scribes drew its full outline; for an ordinary bird they reduced it to the short‑tailed bird form. Thus the character fuses sound and image: like the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="九.html">九</a> in <span class="kanji-inline">鳩</span> that also writes a call, <span class="kanji-inline">鷄</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">鶏</span> captures the rooster’s voice—much as old Japanese kake and English cock echo the same cry.</p>
