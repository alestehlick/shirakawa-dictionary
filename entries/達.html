    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">達</span> is a phono-semantic character. Its semantic side is the “walk/go” radical <span class="kanji-inline">辶</span>, while its phonetic, read tatsu, is the ancient form <span class="kanji-inline">羍</span>, a depiction of a lamb dropping at birth beneath the ewe’s hips, shown as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>. This lively image of a newborn slipping out swiftly and cleanly gives the character the core sense of unhindered movement. In the Book of Odes (Major Odes, Sheng Min), the line <span class="kanji-inline">先</span><span class="kanji-inline">生</span><span class="kanji-inline">如</span><span class="kanji-inline">達</span>, “Her first-born came forth like a lamb,” uses <span class="kanji-inline">達</span> to mean smoothly, without trouble. From this idea of proceeding without obstruction, the character came to mean to pass through and to pierce, and by extension to reach, arrive at, and ultimately to realize or become aware.</p>
