    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">度</span> as a compound formed from an abbreviated <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="席.html">席</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>, the hand. It depicts hands spreading out a straw mat, using the mat’s breadth as a yardstick. From this image come the senses of measuring and the standard or measure itself. Because a mat is laid from end to end, the meaning extends to spanning or crossing a space and, further, to exceeding. From the idea of a fixed standard it also develops the sense of rule or regulation, as seen in compounds like hatto (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="法.html">法</a><span class="kanji-inline">度</span>) and seido (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="制.html">制</a><span class="kanji-inline">度</span>). As a count of occurrences, it is used for “times,” as in sando, “three times.”</p>
