    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph formed by <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> plus <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span>. Here <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> is taken as the figure of meat; two such pieces heaped together evoke an abundance of meat. This image is echoed in the ritual graph <span class="kanji-inline">宜</span>, where two <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> are set above and below a <span class="kanji-inline">且</span> chopping board as offerings in a mausoleum, reinforcing the picture of plentiful sacrificial fare. From this ritual scene the character came to mean “many, much,” and by extension “to excel” and “to be left over, to exceed.” Related characters preserve facets of this sense of surplus or largeness: <span class="kanji-inline">侈</span> speaks of flaunting one’s abundance, <span class="kanji-inline">哆</span> depicts a mouth opened wide, and <span class="kanji-inline">移</span> shows grains (<span class="kanji-inline">禾</span>) with much meat (<span class="kanji-inline">多</span>) in a rite meant to shift misfortune elsewhere.</p>
