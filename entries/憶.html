    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">憶</span> as a phono-semantic character built on the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="意.html">意</a>. The graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="意.html">意</a> itself unites <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="音.html">音</a> “sound” and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a> “heart”: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="音.html">音</a> evokes the faint sound by which the gods, in the stillness of night, signal their response to prayer and inquiry, and so <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="意.html">意</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">憶</span> depict the heart pondering and discerning that divine message. From this inner act of weighing and recollection, <span class="kanji-inline">憶</span> comes to mean remembering what one has experienced and calling back what was learned—hence its use for “to think” and especially “to remember.” Related characters such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="億.html">億</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">臆</span> share the same phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="意.html">意</a>, with <span class="kanji-inline">臆</span> conveying the allied sense of cautious assessment, guessing, and inference.</p>
