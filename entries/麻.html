    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The graph combines the shelter roof <span class="kanji-inline">广</span> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="林.html">林</a> to show bundles of hemp fibers hung beneath the eaves of an ancestral mausoleum, conveying hemp as a material intimately tied to ritual. Hemp was prominently used in sacred and funerary contexts: in Japan, thin split hemp bundled like white hair (shiraka) served in divine rites, and hempen bands and cloth were fastened to the chest, head, or waist in mourning attire. In the Book of Odes (Cao Feng, Fuyou), the “robe of hemp” refers to a white hempen mourning garment. By graphic extension and interchange with <span class="kanji-inline">痲</span>, the character also came to express the sense of numbness or growing numb.</p>
