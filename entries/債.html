    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph, <span class="kanji-inline">債</span> is built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="責.html">責</a> as its phonetic core. In early usage <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="責.html">責</a> (also written <span class="kanji-inline">賚</span>) denoted the act of pressing for payment of tribute and tax (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="賦.html">賦</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貢.html">貢</a>). Accordingly, <span class="kanji-inline">債</span> first referred to the obligation to render such payments. As the concept spread from taxation to the world of lending and borrowing, it came to mean a debt—something one is bound to repay. An anecdote tells of King Nan of Zhou, who, heavily in arrears to his retainers, would flee to a tall tower whenever pressed for repayment; people dubbed it the “tower for evading debt” (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="逃.html">逃</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="責.html">責</a>の<span class="kanji-inline">台</span>). Thus <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="責.html">責</a> is the original character underlying <span class="kanji-inline">債</span>.</p>
