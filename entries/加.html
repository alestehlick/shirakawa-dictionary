    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">加</span> is a compound graph. In early forms the element written like a square opening is not a mouth but a ritual receptacle that held written prayers and covenant texts offered to the gods. Set beside it is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="力.html">力</a>, whose archaic shape evokes the plow (<span class="kanji-inline">耒</span>). Together they depict the ceremony of purifying and exorcising the plow—symbolically “adding” sacred protection to agricultural tools so that insects would not ravage the fields and the autumn yield would rise. From this rite of adding consecration to implements, the character came to mean to attach or add, and by extension, to increase.</p>
