    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">庶</span> as a kitchen scene: the shelter radical <span class="kanji-inline">广</span> shows the roof of a kitchen, beneath which a cooking vessel and the fire marks depict food simmering over a flame. In early forms the character thus meant to boil, and classical texts like the Yili contrast the main dish with the heaped side dishes called <span class="kanji-inline">庶</span><span class="kanji-inline">羞</span>. From this image of assorted side fare arose the senses many and various, reflected in words for miscellaneous affairs (<span class="kanji-inline">庶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="事.html">事</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">庶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="務.html">務</a>) and, by extension, the general populace (<span class="kanji-inline">庶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="人.html">人</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">庶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="民.html">民</a>). By opposition to the main line of a household it also gave <span class="kanji-inline">庶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a>, a child of a secondary wife, and in <span class="kanji-inline">庶</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幾.html">幾</a> it conveys an earnest wish. The original cooking sense later came to be written with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="煮.html">煮</a>, while <span class="kanji-inline">庶</span> retained the ideas of variety and multitude.</p>
