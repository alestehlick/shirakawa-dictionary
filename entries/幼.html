    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">幼</span> as a pictograph: the element for fine, coiled thread (<span class="kanji-inline">幺</span>), imagined as a little reel, is shown with something being forced or bent through it, evoking the act of twisting. From this image the original sense was “to twist,” and <span class="kanji-inline">幼</span> served as the original graph of <span class="kanji-inline">拗</span>, “to twist, to contort.” The familiar meaning “young” arose later by phonetic loan, borrowing the same sound. Classical usage fixes its scope: the Book of Rites says, “Ten years after birth is called <span class="kanji-inline">幼</span>; then one begins to learn,” hence expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">幼</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="学.html">学</a> for the first stage of study around the age of ten.</p>
