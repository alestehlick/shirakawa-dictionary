    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">據</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the hand element <span class="kanji-inline">扌</span> shows the act of placing one’s weight or grasping, while the phonetic element read kyo points to the sound. Early glosses describe it as “holding a cane,” conjuring the image of leaning the body on a support. Shirakawa further notes the association of kyo with the firm metal staple of a hanging bell (<span class="kanji-inline">鐻</span>), reinforcing the idea of a secure, reliable point of support. From this image of the hand finding a place to lean, the character comes to mean to rely on something, to make it a basis or grounds, and by extension to occupy or hold a position.</p>
