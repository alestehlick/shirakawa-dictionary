    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">續</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the thread radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a> signals the idea of strands and linking, while <span class="kanji-inline">賣</span> (later simplified as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="売.html">売</a>) functions as the phonetic that gives the on reading. The Shuowen glosses it as “to stretch out, run in a line,” evoking threads drawn out in succession. From this image it came to mean things that continue, are kept up, or are strung together in a row. In both sound and sense it stands close to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="属.html">属</a> (zoku).</p>
