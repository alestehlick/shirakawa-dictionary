    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">踐</span>, this is a phono-semantic character combining the foot element with <span class="kanji-inline">戔</span> as the phonetic, which signals the On reading sen. <span class="kanji-inline">戔</span> depicts long, narrow pikes (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>) stacked up, suggesting a state of flat things piled one upon another. Set beside the foot component, it evokes footprints overlapping—steps heaped up in succession—hence the senses “to tread,” “to trample,” and “to walk.” This imagery connects to ritual practice: in Japan, the henbai rite (<span class="kanji-inline">反</span><span class="kanji-inline">閇</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">反</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="閉.html">閉</a>) consisted of stamping the floor to pacify the earth spirit, a practice corresponding to what ancient China called <span class="kanji-inline">践</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a>. In formal ceremonies one advanced in measured steps, described as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="履.html">履</a><span class="kanji-inline">践</span>, “to perform, to conduct,” and from this ritual comportment the character naturally extended to mean carrying something out or implementing it.</p>
