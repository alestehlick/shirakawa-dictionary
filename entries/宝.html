    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">寶</span>, this is a picto-phonetic character. It shows the roof of the ancestral mausoleum (<span class="kanji-inline">宀</span>), under which offerings are set out: jade (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="玉.html">玉</a>), cowry shells (<span class="kanji-inline">貝</span>, once used as valuables), and an earthen jar (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="缶.html">缶</a>) for wine or water. The jar element also serves as the phonetic, which underlies the Sino-Japanese reading. The graph thus names the precious items presented in the ancestral shrine—hence “treasure.” The Shuowen glosses it as “rare,” explaining it in the sense of a “rare treasure” (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="珍.html">珍</a><span class="kanji-inline">宝</span>). Bronze inscriptions often include dedicatory phrases such as “to make a treasured ritual vessel,” reflecting its association with prized sacrificial objects.</p>
