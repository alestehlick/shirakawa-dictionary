    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">乘</span>, the character shows two people who have climbed onto the spreading branch of a tree. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions the upper element is clearly a tree limb rather than the grain plant, evoking the act of scaling a high tree to keep watch for the enemy. In those inscriptions we also find the clan name <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="望.html">望</a><span class="kanji-inline">乘</span> (Bōjō), likely responsible for such lookout duties. In later usage tied to chariotry, regulations prescribed a four-horse team, so <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="一.html">一</a><span class="kanji-inline">乗</span> came to denote “one team of four,” and by extension <span class="kanji-inline">乗</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="矢.html">矢</a> referred to a set of four arrows. Because a chariot quickens the pace of events, <span class="kanji-inline">乗</span>ず developed the sense of seizing the moment. From the core image of mounting and being borne aloft, the character broadened to mean to ride, get on, join, and to capitalize on an opportunity.</p>
