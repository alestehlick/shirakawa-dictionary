    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">術</span> is a compound graph built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">朮</span>. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a> shows great roads crossing at a junction—a place where many spirits were believed to pass—so crossroads became sites for potent ritual practice. <span class="kanji-inline">朮</span> represents an animal endowed with spirit power. At such roads, diviners employed the spirit-guided techniques associated with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="述.html">述</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="遂.html">遂</a> to consult fate and determine whether an army should attack or advance, and then to proceed in accordance with that verdict. From this sense of efficacious ritual technique, <span class="kanji-inline">術</span> broadened to mean cultivated skill and learned method, and now extends to fields such as technology, the arts, and scholarship.</p>
