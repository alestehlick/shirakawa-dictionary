    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This compound brings together <span class="kanji-inline">癶</span>, the figure of both feet poised to set off, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="豆.html">豆</a>, a tall-footed vessel that can also be seen as a stepping stand. Placing ready feet upon that stand gives the sense of climbing and rising. In oracle-bone and bronze script there is also a special form where <span class="kanji-inline">廾</span>, two hands, lift the high-footed <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="豆.html">豆</a>, expressing the act of raising a vessel to make an offering and, by extension, presenting or recommending something. The character is further used for abundant fruition, as in expressions describing crops that bear well, hence the nuance of ripening.</p>
