    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: its upper element was originally the graph <span class="kanji-inline">之</span>, which supplies the on reading shi and carries the sense of going, while the lower part is the heart, <span class="kanji-inline">心</span>. Together they picture a heart set toward a direction—an inward resolve or intention. The Great Preface to the Book of Odes expresses this idea: what abides in the heart is zhi; when voiced, it becomes poetry. In early usage <span class="kanji-inline">志</span> thus meant what is held in the heart and also the act of setting it down in one’s mind, which led to its occasional use in place of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="誌.html">誌</a>, “to record.”</p>
