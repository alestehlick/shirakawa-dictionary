    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">控</span> is a phono-semantic compound: the hand radical (<span class="kanji-inline">扌</span>) marks a concrete manual action, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="空.html">空</a> supplies the sound (kō). The Shuowen already glosses it as “to pull,” used of drawing a bow and even of an arrow’s descent, and by extension for tugging at a horse. Zhuangzi (Waiwu) vividly has <span class="kanji-inline">控</span><span class="kanji-inline">其</span><span class="kanji-inline">頤</span>, prying back the jaw to remove the funerary jade set in the mouth of the dead. From these scenes, the character evokes drawing back and holding something in check—Shirakawa even hears in it the creak of the bowstring or the knock against the jaw—an image that naturally broadens in Japanese to hikaeru “to refrain, to hold back,” to the anteroom <span class="kanji-inline">控</span><span class="kanji-inline">室</span> where one waits in readiness, and to “jotting down” notes as something kept in reserve.</p>
