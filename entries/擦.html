    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">擦</span> is a phono-semantic character formed with the hand radical indicating a manual action and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="察.html">察</a> as the phonetic, which gives the on reading satsu. Shirakawa understands <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="察.html">察</a> as the act of sensing the gods’ will through ritual worship (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="祭.html">祭</a>), an encounter at the liminal edge where deities and humans come into contact. Carried over into <span class="kanji-inline">擦</span>, that image of contact suggests the sound and feel of hands rubbing against each other, from which the meanings “to rub” and “to chafe” arise. The character is not attested in the oracle-bone or bronze inscriptions and comes into use only from the Song–Yuan period (10th–14th century).</p>
