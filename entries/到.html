    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the bronze inscriptions the character appears as a form combining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="至.html">至</a> and a person, depicting someone standing at the spot an arrow has reached. Since <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="至.html">至</a> shows the point hit by a shot arrow, placing a person there naturally gives the sense of to arrive or to be at a destination. From this image also grow nuances of coming to the very end or utmost, hence compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">到</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="底.html">底</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">到</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="頭.html">頭</a> that convey eventuality, culmination, and thoroughness. In early usage this same graph could also mean to do or to cause; over time these strands differentiated, yielding the modern characters <span class="kanji-inline">到</span> for arrival and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="致.html">致</a> for causing.</p>
