    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A picto-phonetic character formed with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a>, the altar table of rites, supplying the on reading shi, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="見.html">見</a>, originally a kneeling person with accentuated eyes, providing the sense of seeing. It evokes standing before the altar and gazing upon the deity’s figure—perceiving what the divine will reveals. From this sacred act it comes to mean not only to look or see, but also, by looking up to what is made manifest, to show or display. Classical literature preserves more than thirty characters read miru, each marking a distinct way of seeing.</p>
