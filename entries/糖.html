    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the semantic element <span class="kanji-inline">米</span> evokes grain and sweetness, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="唐.html">唐</a> functions as the phonetic, giving the on reading tō. There is also an older form <span class="kanji-inline">餳</span> written with the food radical and the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">易</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">昜</span>; the same phonetic lineage appears in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="湯.html">湯</a> (tō, hot water). In earlier usage it referred to ame—sweet candy—but in later Japanese it came to mean refined sugar, especially from sugarcane, as in tōbun (sugar content) and seitō (sugar production). In confectionery it names decorative candies such as tōka and tōryū, also known as konpeitō.</p>
