    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">始</span> as a phono-semantic graph anchored in ritual. The left side, <span class="kanji-inline">女</span>, sets the scene of woman and childbirth. The right side, written with <span class="kanji-inline">台</span> as the phonetic shi, points to an inaugural agricultural ceremony: prayers were inscribed and placed in a covenant vessel, and the plow—shown as a stylized implement—was ritually purified before the first tilling so that insects would not ravage the harvest. Because human birth was understood in parallel with the sprouting of crops, the same purificatory rite attended an infant’s arrival. The character thus depicts a woman holding the plow and covenant vessel as she prays for a safe delivery. From this core sense of bringing forth life, the meaning broadened to ‘to begin,’ ‘start,’ and ‘beginning.’</p>
