    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">床</span> is a phono-semantic character whose original form was <span class="kanji-inline">牀</span>, a drawing of a wooden bedstead. In that older graph, <span class="kanji-inline">爿</span> provides the sound (shō) and, even though it was not used independently with the meaning “bed,” it itself sketches the frame of a bed. The later form <span class="kanji-inline">床</span> came into general use and, although the Yu Pian labeled it a vulgar variant of <span class="kanji-inline">牀</span>, it is well attested from the Tang period. A Tang-era anecdote in the Shi Tong speaks of “setting a bed upon a bed,” like building a house atop a house, to exemplify pointless effort. While the basic meaning is “bed,” in Japanese the word extends naturally to the floor and to the decorative alcove of a reception room, seen in uses such as tokonoma, tokoyama, and yukaue.</p>
