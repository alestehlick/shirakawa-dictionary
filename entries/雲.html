    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">雲</span> is a phono-semantic character: the semantic is the rain radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="雨.html">雨</a>, and the phonetic is <span class="kanji-inline">云</span> (un). In archaic forms, <span class="kanji-inline">云</span> depicts the faintly coiled tail of a dragon glimpsed beneath drifting vapors, a vivid image that conveyed the idea of “cloud.” Over time, the rain element was added to yield the modern graph <span class="kanji-inline">雲</span>. Because clouds gather and blur into indistinguishable masses, the character also came to suggest a state of accumulation or confusion, a nuance reflected in derivatives such as <span class="kanji-inline">紜</span> (un), describing tangled threads, and <span class="kanji-inline">耘</span> (un), “to till,” breaking soil into fine, many pieces. Meanwhile, <span class="kanji-inline">云</span> itself diverged in usage to mean “to say,” as in <span class="kanji-inline">云</span>う (iu).</p>
