    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic compound: in older forms the left component is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="右.html">右</a>, used for its sound yuu, while the right component <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span> is the small-bird graph that gives the meaning. Han-period inscriptions often show the layout explicitly as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="右.html">右</a> on the left with <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span> on the right. The Shuowen glosses it as the “father-bird,” that is, the male of birds, and from this core sense the character naturally came to express masculine strength and heroic vigor. Hence its use in contrasts such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="雌.html">雌</a><span class="kanji-inline">雄</span> for female and male birds (with <span class="kanji-inline">牝</span><span class="kanji-inline">牡</span> reserved for quadrupeds), and in compounds praising manly courage and grandeur.</p>
