    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally a pictograph, <span class="kanji-inline">朱</span> shows a tree-like shaft marked with a bold dot; in bronze script forms an upper hole element functions as a flue, picturing the apparatus used to steam and fumigate cinnabar (shusha) to separate and solidify the mineral into pigment. As a mineral color rather than a plant dye, its brilliance does not fade: even after more than three millennia, Shang ritual vessels still retain vivid vermilion, and in some tombs the vessel has perished while the vermilion remains adhered to the soil. The term kado, “flower earth,” refers to such bright vermilion earth. In antiquity, this enduring hue was cherished as a color of life and of immortality.</p>
