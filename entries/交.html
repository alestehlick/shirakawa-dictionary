    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest pictographic form, <span class="kanji-inline">交</span> shows a person seen from the front with legs crossed. From this image of crossing came the senses of intersecting and mingling, and then social association, as in ideas of companionship and intercourse (seen in words like kousai and kouyuu). From “to cross/mingle” it naturally broadened to mutuality (“each other”), change, and the act of exchanging or laying things across—hence its use in trade (koueki) for exchanging goods. The crossed-legs posture itself seems to have been regarded as graceful, which is echoed in related graphs such as <span class="kanji-inline">佼</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">姣</span> meaning good-looking or beautiful.</p>
