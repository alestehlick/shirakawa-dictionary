    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the water radical signals meaning, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="原.html">原</a> provides the sound gen and evokes an older form depicting water flowing between cliffs—the very image of a spring. Over time, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="原.html">原</a> was borrowed to write hara, an open plain, so the water element was added to preserve the older sense, yielding <span class="kanji-inline">源</span> for a water source. Early inscriptions already reflect this division, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="原.html">原</a> used for an even plain and <span class="kanji-inline">源</span> for a spring. From the concrete image of a wellspring, the character naturally extended to the abstract ideas of beginning and basis—the source of things in general.</p>
