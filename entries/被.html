    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Being a phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">被</span> combines the clothing element with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皮.html">皮</a> as its phonetic, which supplies the On reading hi and evokes the idea of something that covers a surface. Early lexicography defines it as a sleeping coverlet—long enough to measure one and a half times the body—later called small sleeping quilt (shogahi), and in Japan remembered in the long collared, sleeved nightwear termed <span class="kanji-inline">被</span><span class="kanji-inline">衾</span>. Thus it first named what one spreads over oneself in sleep—bedclothes, a quilt or nightgown—and by extension the act of putting it on and covering from above. From the notion of being covered came the verbal sense “to receive, to incur, to suffer,” and in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">被</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="害.html">害</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">被</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="告.html">告</a> it expresses the passive idea of being subjected to another’s action. (By contrast, <span class="kanji-inline">衾</span> specifically names the coverlet itself.)</p>
