    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">井</span> as a pictograph of the igeta, the crossed wooden crib that reinforces a well’s mouth. In antiquity this same lattice-like form was used broadly for framed or restraining structures: the shackle used in punishment, a pitfall for trapping people or animals, and the outer frame of a mold. These senses were later distinguished as separate characters—<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刑.html">刑</a> for the shackle, <span class="kanji-inline">穽</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">阱</span>) for the pit, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="型.html">型</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="形.html">形</a> for the mold and form—where the old <span class="kanji-inline">井</span> shape was remodeled as <span class="kanji-inline">开</span> within them. To make the “well” meaning explicit, a ladle/pot sign was sometimes added, producing <span class="kanji-inline">丼</span>, which in Japan came to denote the donburi bowl. From its original picture, <span class="kanji-inline">井</span> thus means a well and its wooden frame, and by extension could also refer to a settlement such as a village or town.</p>
