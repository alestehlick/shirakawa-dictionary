    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">諭</span> is a phono-semantic character in which <span class="kanji-inline">兪</span> (yu) functions as the phonetic and carries the image of lancing an abscess and draining it into a basin—here the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> component within <span class="kanji-inline">兪</span> is actually <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舟.html">舟</a>, the form of a tub or plate—signifying recovery from illness or injury. By analogy with such healing, <span class="kanji-inline">諭</span> depicts using words to set someone right: to admonish gently, to advise, and to remonstrate so that faults are corrected. A related graph, <span class="kanji-inline">喩</span> (yu), speaks of figurative expression used in admonition and guidance.</p>
