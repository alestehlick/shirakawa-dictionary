    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character: the earth/clay element points to an earthen structure, while the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">亘</span>—also seen in characters read en such as <span class="kanji-inline">洹</span> (the name of a river)—serves as the on-reading indicator and originally suggested a line encircling a space. <span class="kanji-inline">垣</span> therefore denotes the clay wall that surrounds a building, hence “fence” or “hedge.” In antiquity its on reading matched that of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="院.html">院</a>, which originally referred to a sacred precinct or building furnished with such an enclosing wall. Early forms even show the encircling element set against fortress walls, emphasizing that a <span class="kanji-inline">垣</span> was the earthen enclosure of a fort.</p>
