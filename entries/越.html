    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">越</span> as a phono-semantic compound: the movement element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="走.html">走</a> combines with the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">戉</span> (etsu), the form of a ritual broadax. In ancient practice, when people faced hazardous crossings, a consecrated axe served as a curse implement; by stepping over it, one drew its numinous power before setting out—an idea he also notes in the background of <span class="kanji-inline">往</span>. With that ritual transfer of strength at its core, <span class="kanji-inline">越</span> comes to mean going on under the axe’s imbued power: to go over or beyond, to cross, to pass, and by extension to surpass or exceed.</p>
