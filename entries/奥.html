    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character combines three elements: under the roof of a ritual building (<span class="kanji-inline">宀</span>), a beast’s claw or paw is shown (<span class="kanji-inline">釆</span>), with the upper stroke suggesting the claw and the lower, rice-like pattern evoking the lines of the palm, while two hands held together in offering appear below (<span class="kanji-inline">廾</span>). Together they picture the innermost corner of a house where a sacred offering—the meat of a beast’s claw—was presented with both hands. From this image of the most secluded, consecrated recess, the character came to mean the inner part and, by extension, the depths.</p>
