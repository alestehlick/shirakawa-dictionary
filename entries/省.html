    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In bronze inscription forms, the character places the eye <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="目.html">目</a> beneath <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="生.html">生</a>, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="生.html">生</a> serving as the phonetic; in later scripts this phonetic appears as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="少.html">少</a>, which accounts for the two On readings sei and sho. The shapes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="生.html">生</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="少.html">少</a> were likely stylized eyebrows with added decoration—adornments thought to heighten the eye’s cursing, magical power. <span class="kanji-inline">省</span> originally depicted making one’s rounds with such empowered eyes: patrolling, inspecting, and purifying. Bronze texts even record <span class="kanji-inline">省</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="道.html">道</a>, “to make the round of the road,” meaning to cleanse and exorcize the way. From this core image developed the senses of looking and self-reflection (as in seisatsu and hansei), and, by removing what ought to be taken away during inspection, the meanings “omit” and “reduce” (as in shoryaku).</p>
