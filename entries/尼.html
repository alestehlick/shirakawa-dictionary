    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Composed of <span class="kanji-inline">尸</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">匕</span>, both originally human figures, this character depicts one person leaning in against the back of another. From that image it first conveyed the sense of drawing near and becoming familiar. In later usage it came to designate a Buddhist nun, as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">尼</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="僧.html">僧</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="僧.html">僧</a><span class="kanji-inline">尼</span>. The graph also echoes in tradition surrounding Confucius: he was said to have been born at Mount Ni (<span class="kanji-inline">尼</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="山.html">山</a>), from which his style name Zhong Ni (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="仲.html">仲</a><span class="kanji-inline">尼</span>) was formed, while his given name Qiu (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丘.html">丘</a>) reflects a division of the place name Ni Qiu (<span class="kanji-inline">尼</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丘.html">丘</a>).</p>
