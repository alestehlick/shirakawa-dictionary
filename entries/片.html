    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a pictograph of a single support plank used in the tamped‑earth construction method called hanchiku, where boards stood upright on the left and right and earth was rammed between them to form walls. <span class="kanji-inline">片</span> depicts one of those paired boards, so it naturally came to mean “one side.” From the idea of just one of a pair, it extends to senses such as a lone piece or fragment, and by association to something thin and small—a piece of wood or cloth, or a flat sheet or leaf—and even to the nuance of something slight or few in amount.</p>
