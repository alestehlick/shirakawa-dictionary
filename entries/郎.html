    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">郎</span> is a phono-semantic character. Its early form writes <span class="kanji-inline">郎</span> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="良.html">良</a> as the phonetic, which gives the on reading and carries the idea of “good.” <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="良.html">良</a> originally depicted a winnowing implement that sent air through grain to drive off the chaff, keeping only the sound kernels; from this act of selecting the good it came to mean “good.” In <span class="kanji-inline">郎</span>, that phonetic not only supplies the sound but also suggests a “good man,” and the character was used for naming a male child, for a young man or husband, as a polite address (“lord,” “you”), and as the title of an official post.</p>
