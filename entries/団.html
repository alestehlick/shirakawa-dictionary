    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">團</span>, this is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">專</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="専.html">専</a>) as the phonetic, indicating the on reading. Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">專</span> as the image of something placed in a tied sack (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="恵.html">恵</a>) and pressed and beaten by a hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a>) until it becomes a rounded mass. <span class="kanji-inline">團</span> then adds an outer wrapping, suggesting an even more completely rounded, bundled form. From this concrete scene come the senses of “round,” “to gather into a rounded mass,” “lump or clod,” and by extension “group” or “team.” The same hand-worked idea appears in related graphs like <span class="kanji-inline">搏</span>, which depict beating and rolling something up by hand.</p>
