    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">遺</span> is a phono-semantic character built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貴.html">貴</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span>. The <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貴.html">貴</a> element serves as the sound and depicts a precious cowry shell—once a treasured, protective talisman for safe childbirth—being held up with both hands as an offering. <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> combines the path radical and a footprint to show movement or going. Together they picture going forth to present a cherished treasure to someone, hence the sense of sending or making a bequest; from the giver’s side, the item departs, which yields the meaning “to lose,” and by further extension it also means “to leave behind,” as in the idea of something remaining after one’s death.</p>
