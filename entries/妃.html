    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">妃</span> is a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a> “woman” and <span class="kanji-inline">巳</span>, the pictograph of a snake—a creature revered as a nature spirit. In early ritual language (<span class="kanji-inline">祀</span>), such spirits were formally worshiped, and oracle-bone divinations ask whether the “Spirit Consort” should be propitiated, showing <span class="kanji-inline">妃</span> used for a woman honored as a deity. In bronze inscriptions it appears in exalted posthumous titles together with <span class="kanji-inline">妣</span> “deceased mother,” as in formulas like “Royal Deceased Mother, Filial Great Consort,” where <span class="kanji-inline">妃</span> marks an honorific rank. From these sacred and honorific uses, the character came to denote the king’s consort—the wife of the Son of Heaven—hence the later sense of queen or imperial consort.</p>
