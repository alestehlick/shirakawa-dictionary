    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the ancient script, <span class="kanji-inline">美</span> is a pictograph of a sheep shown in its complete, harmonious form. The upper part renders the animal from the front—its head and horns—while the lower element, written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>, evokes the hindquarters: the stance associated with a ewe’s hips and the way a newborn lamb drops down at birth. Together they depict the sheep from horns to hind legs, and thus name the beauty of a fully grown, well-formed animal. In ritual practice, a sacrificial sheep had to be flawless; the same ideal appears in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="義.html">義</a>, which combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="羊.html">羊</a> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="我.html">我</a> (a saw) to signify something perfectly sound and correct. From this image of a beautiful, perfect sheep, <span class="kanji-inline">美</span> came to mean “beautiful” in general, and by extension “good” and praiseworthy.</p>
