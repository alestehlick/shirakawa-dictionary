    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">作</span> as a phono-semantic graph built on <span class="kanji-inline">乍</span>, which supplies the on-reading saku and preserves the core sense of making. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">乍</span> originally depicted bending tree branches to weave a fence or the like, and in oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions it refers to constructing a fortress wall or crafting a bronze vessel. <span class="kanji-inline">乍</span> was the original character; later, <span class="kanji-inline">作</span> was created to express deliberate making and agency (as in sakui). From the concrete act of making a particular object, the meaning broadened to encompass human activity in general—carrying out, setting in motion, causing, or accomplishing—hence compounds such as sakkō, “to arouse or promote.”</p>
