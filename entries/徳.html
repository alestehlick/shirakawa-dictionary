    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">徳</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="省.html">省</a>, and later <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a>. In the oracle‑bone and early bronze forms, <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span> joins <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="省.html">省</a>: <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, the “step” beside <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a>, evokes moving along a path, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="省.html">省</a> originally depicts a ritual ornament fixed at the brows to intensify the eyes’ numinous curse‑power, with which one made an inspecting circuit and warded off impurity. With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a> added, the graph came to mean extending the eyes’ purifying authority outward into one’s conduct. At first, then, <span class="kanji-inline">徳</span> named the potent, cleansing force of the gaze; as that force was recognized as arising from an inner human faculty, it took on the sense of virtue—an inherent moral power that makes what is correct and good and bestows grace—hence compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="道.html">道</a><span class="kanji-inline">徳</span> (morality) and <span class="kanji-inline">徳</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="性.html">性</a> (moral character).</p>
