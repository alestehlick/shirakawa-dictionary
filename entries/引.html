    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph formed from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="弓.html">弓</a>, a bow, and a single straight stroke understood as the taut bowstring. Even without securely attested archaic forms, the composition vividly pictures drawing the string of a bow. Other graphs that once shared its on reading also evoke the act of pulling a bowstring, reinforcing this image. From that concrete scene, the sense broadened to pulling by physical strength in general, and further to actions such as leading or drawing back.</p>
