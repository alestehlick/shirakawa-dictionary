    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">實</span>, the character combines the roof radical <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span>—the roof of a mausoleum where ancestral spirits are venerated—with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貫.html">貫</a>, strings of shell currency threaded on a cord. Together they depict a corded bundle of coins offered at the ancestral shrine, an image of abundant, ample offerings. From this core sense arises the meanings “to be full, replete,” and by natural extension “to bear fruit” and “fruit” itself (as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="果.html">果</a><span class="kanji-inline">実</span>), referring to the seed and the covering that encloses it. When the heart is filled with right intention, the character also expresses “sincerity” and “truth” (as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="誠.html">誠</a><span class="kanji-inline">実</span>), and thus “truly, really.”</p>
