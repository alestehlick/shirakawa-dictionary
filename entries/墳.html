    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">墳</span> is a phono-semantic character: the earth element supports the meaning, while the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">賁</span> provides the sound fun and evokes the image of flowers opening all at once—an inner force swelling upward and outward. From this sense of earth rising in a heap, <span class="kanji-inline">墳</span> came to mean a grave marked by piled soil, and by extension any mound-like heap such as a hill or an embankment. Lexicographers already glossed it as a grave of heaped earth. Although Shang imperial burials were deep in the ground, ritual tradition describes modest mounding: the Book of Rites records Confucius raising a mound four shaku high for his mother and observing that in ancient times graves were made without lofty heaps. The character thus centers on the gentle earthen rise that signifies a burial.</p>
