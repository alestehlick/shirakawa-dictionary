    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">菓</span> is a phono-semantic character: the grass crown signals a plant, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="果.html">果</a> provides the sound ka and originally depicts a fruit borne on a tree. Though its form points to a plant’s fruit, the word came to mean confectionery, reflecting ancient practice in which sweets were made by processing fruits—preserving them with sugar and similar methods. Hence compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">菓</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="盤.html">盤</a> (kaban, “fruit/sweets tray”) can denote a tray for either fruit or confections, preserving the old link between fruit and sweets.</p>
