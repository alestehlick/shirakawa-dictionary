    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">願</span> is a phono-semantic character. The phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="原.html">原</a> supplies the on-yomi and carries an old nuance of circumspection, with early glosses explaining it in terms of a “large head” and “to think,” pointing to deep, deliberate thought. The semantic component <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span> is the head, drawn as a worshipper, a figure in reverent address to the gods. Combined, they express a respectful entreaty born of considered thought, which is why the character comes to mean to make a wish or petition with deference.</p>
