    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">說</span>, the character combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a>, the solemn words or oaths addressed to the gods, with <span class="kanji-inline">兌</span>, which signals the on-reading but also carries a sacred image. Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">兌</span> as the gentle descent of the divine breath in answer to a shaman’s petitions—here, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="兄.html">兄</a> evokes one who serves the gods—capturing the rapt, possessed state of the medium. The related form <span class="kanji-inline">悅</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="悦.html">悦</a>) shows the shaman’s heart in that moment of divine ecstasy. From this scene of praying to and persuading the deities, <span class="kanji-inline">說</span> broadened to mean persuading people, and by extension explaining and stating; it was even used in place of <span class="kanji-inline">悅</span> with the sense “to be glad.”</p>
