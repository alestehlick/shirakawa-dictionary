    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats <span class="kanji-inline">太</span> as a phono-semantic graph in which <span class="kanji-inline">大</span> serves as the phonetic, pointing to the on reading tai, and as an abbreviated form of <span class="kanji-inline">泰</span>. The older form <span class="kanji-inline">泰</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">大</span> (a person seen from the front with arms and legs outstretched), <span class="kanji-inline">収</span> (the two hands set side by side), and <span class="kanji-inline">水</span> (water), depicting both hands lifting someone up from the water. From this scene arise senses such as peaceful and gentle, and by extension rich, abundant, great, and very. In <span class="kanji-inline">太</span>, the small dot beneath <span class="kanji-inline">大</span> is a shorthand for the <span class="kanji-inline">水</span> of <span class="kanji-inline">泰</span>, preserving that origin. Early texts often do not distinguish clearly among <span class="kanji-inline">泰</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">太</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">大</span>, though usage later settled: <span class="kanji-inline">太</span> is the choice in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">太</span><span class="kanji-inline">極</span> (the principle that structures the cosmos), <span class="kanji-inline">太</span><span class="kanji-inline">古</span> (remote antiquity), <span class="kanji-inline">太</span><span class="kanji-inline">子</span> (the Crown Prince), and <span class="kanji-inline">太</span><span class="kanji-inline">陽</span> (the sun). In Japanese it also carries the native readings futoi and futoru, as in ‘a thick tree’ or ‘to grow fat.’</p>
