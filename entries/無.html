    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally a pictograph, <span class="kanji-inline">無</span> shows a dancer with ornamented sleeves fluttering as they move. In oracle-bone (tortoise plastron) and bronze inscriptions it appears in rain-invoking rites, as in <span class="kanji-inline">無</span><span class="kanji-inline">雩</span>, a ceremony of prayer for rain. Its later use for “not, nothing; there is none,” as in <span class="kanji-inline">有</span><span class="kanji-inline">無</span>, is a phonetic loan: the graph’s sound was borrowed to write negation. Over time <span class="kanji-inline">無</span> specialized as the standard character for negation, while <span class="kanji-inline">舞</span>—formed by combining <span class="kanji-inline">無</span> with <span class="kanji-inline">舛</span>, the splayed legs of a dancer—was created to write “to dance” and “dance” explicitly.</p>
