    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Early forms of <span class="kanji-inline">狂</span> place the sign for a footstep (zhi, <span class="kanji-inline">之</span>) upon the king’s axe (wang, <span class="kanji-inline">王</span>), the axehead being the emblem of royal rank; <span class="kanji-inline">王</span> also serves as the phonetic that carries the on reading. When envoys departed on the king’s command, they trod upon the axe in a send‑off rite to receive its numinous power. From this image the character came to mean “to go mad” in the sense of being seized by extraordinary, otherworldly vigor—like the power imparted by touching the axe set before the jade throne. This positive coloring appears in the Analects’ pairing <span class="kanji-inline">狂</span><span class="kanji-inline">狷</span>: the “kuang” are those fired by lofty ambition who press forward. When perfectly balanced men were lacking, such inspired intensity was valued, and those who lived by high ideals apart from the common way were admired.</p>
