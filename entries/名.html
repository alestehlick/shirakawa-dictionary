    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">名</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">口</span>. Here <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> is an abbreviated form of <span class="kanji-inline">肉</span>, the meat offered in ancestral rites, while <span class="kanji-inline">口</span> depicts the sacred covenant vessel (sai) into which written prayers to the gods were placed. When a newborn survived its first vulnerable days, a rite was held in the ancestral mausoleum: meat was presented, a prayer proclaiming the child’s growth was recited, and at that moment the child received a <span class="kanji-inline">名</span>. From this ritual act came the senses “name” and “to name,” and by extension the idea of publicly acknowledged “reputation” or “fame,” as in <span class="kanji-inline">名</span><span class="kanji-inline">声</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">名</span><span class="kanji-inline">望</span>. In the same tradition, one first received a childhood name (<span class="kanji-inline">幼</span><span class="kanji-inline">名</span>), and later, at another temple rite, underwent formal naming (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a><span class="kanji-inline">名</span>); to avoid uttering the personal name, a courtesy name (<span class="kanji-inline">字</span>, azana) was adopted, often chosen in deliberate relation to the given <span class="kanji-inline">名</span> and used as the ordinary, everyday name.</p>
