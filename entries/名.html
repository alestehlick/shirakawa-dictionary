    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">名</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夕.html">夕</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夕.html">夕</a> is an abbreviated form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="肉.html">肉</a>, the meat offered in ancestral rites, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> depicts the sacred covenant vessel (sai) into which written prayers to the gods were placed. When a newborn survived its first vulnerable days, a rite was held in the ancestral mausoleum: meat was presented, a prayer proclaiming the child’s growth was recited, and at that moment the child received a <span class="kanji-inline">名</span>. From this ritual act came the senses “name” and “to name,” and by extension the idea of publicly acknowledged “reputation” or “fame,” as in <span class="kanji-inline">名</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="声.html">声</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">名</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="望.html">望</a>. In the same tradition, one first received a childhood name (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幼.html">幼</a><span class="kanji-inline">名</span>), and later, at another temple rite, underwent formal naming (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a><span class="kanji-inline">名</span>); to avoid uttering the personal name, a courtesy name (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="字.html">字</a>, azana) was adopted, often chosen in deliberate relation to the given <span class="kanji-inline">名</span> and used as the ordinary, everyday name.</p>
