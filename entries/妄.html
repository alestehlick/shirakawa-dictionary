    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa presents <span class="kanji-inline">妄</span> as a phono-semantic character, with <span class="kanji-inline">亡</span> acting as the phonetic that points to the on-reading mou. The Shuowen glosses its core sense as “to become disordered,” and further defines it as wild, baseless talk. From this nucleus arise the meanings “recklessly, indiscriminately” and “false, unfounded,” seen in words such as <span class="kanji-inline">妄</span><span class="kanji-inline">信</span> (credulous belief) and <span class="kanji-inline">妄</span><span class="kanji-inline">想</span> (fanciful delusion). In Buddhist usage, terms like <span class="kanji-inline">妄</span><span class="kanji-inline">心</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">妄</span><span class="kanji-inline">念</span> name a mind bewildered and stained by passions, while <span class="kanji-inline">妄</span><span class="kanji-inline">執</span> describes the clinging attachment that grows out of such delusion.</p>
