    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">鑄</span>, this character took <span class="kanji-inline">壽</span> (ju) as a phonetic to mark the on reading chuu, as seen also in <span class="kanji-inline">疇</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">躊</span>. The earliest bronze-inscription forms, however, are straightforwardly pictorial: two hands hold a<span class="kanji-inline">鬲</span>-type vessel set over fire, a vivid image of the casting process—melting metal and pouring it into a mold. The Shuowen glosses it as “to liquefy metal,” and the character is used for actions such as iru and ikomu, casting metal into a prepared mold. With the later addition of <span class="kanji-inline">壽</span> as a phonetic element, the graph settled into a phono-semantic form.</p>
