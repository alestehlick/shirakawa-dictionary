    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the foot radical marks the act of stepping, while the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">沓</span> (read tou) carries an older ritual nuance. Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">沓</span> as combining the sign of water with a figure of a ritual container that held written prayers; pouring water over it defiled the vessel and annulled the prayer’s power. In some early sources the form uses <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="易.html">易</a> as the phonetic, understood as the inversion of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="習.html">習</a>—where <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="習.html">習</a> denotes rubbing to quicken a prayer’s efficacy, its inversion conveys the canceling of that efficacy. Within this frame, <span class="kanji-inline">踏</span> (and related <span class="kanji-inline">蹋</span>) depicts treading not only as a physical step but as a deliberate, defiling stamp—trampling to suppress. In antiquity, such treading was a magical act performed to pacify earth spirits, and Chinese folk custom preserved various rites centered on ritual stepping.</p>
