    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats <span class="kanji-inline">店</span> as a phono‑semantic character, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="占.html">占</a> acting as the phonetic that signals the On reading ten, as seen in related graphs like <span class="kanji-inline">佔</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">坫</span>. The Jade Book (Gyoku Hen) explains <span class="kanji-inline">坫</span> as the stand where wine cups are set back; while that sense belongs chiefly to <span class="kanji-inline">坫</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">店</span> likely began as a variant of it. From the image of goods laid out in the corner of a hall like cups arranged on a stand, the graph came to mean a place of display and sale—a shop. Its use later broadened to lodging, a traveler’s inn or hotel, as reflected in compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="飯.html">飯</a><span class="kanji-inline">店</span>, which can denote a hotel and, in Japanese usage, also the name for a Chinese restaurant.</p>
