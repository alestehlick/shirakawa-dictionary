    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">濃</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water element signals liquid and moisture, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="農.html">農</a> provides the sound and a vivid image. In Shirakawa’s view, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="農.html">農</a> originally evoked tilling with an agricultural implement fashioned from a clam shell (<span class="kanji-inline">辰</span>), an act of earnest, concentrated labor. From that association it came to suggest warmth and intensity. Joined with water, the character expresses richness and thickness in fluids; early lexicography even glosses it as “abundant dew.” Thus <span class="kanji-inline">濃</span> describes what is dense, deep, and strong—dark in color, thick in substance—and by extension conveys the depth and intensity of human feelings.</p>
