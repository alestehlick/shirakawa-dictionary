    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">香</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">黍</span>, “millet,” with a graph Shirakawa understands not as the sun but as the covenant vessel sai, holding a written prayer. The image is of offering millet while voicing petitions to the gods. Early texts tell that the sweet fragrance of millet cakes and other grain offerings moves the heart of the deity; worshipers would also pour fragrant wine, roast a dog, and let the aroma rise to heaven. From this scene of prayer through scented offerings, <span class="kanji-inline">香</span> came to signify fragrance and sweet smell, and by extension became a metaphor for cultivated elegance, as in expressions like kôkon (“fragrant soul,” the spirit of a beauty) and kômu (“a dream of blossoms”).</p>
