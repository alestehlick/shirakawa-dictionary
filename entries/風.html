    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A picto-phonetic graph. In oracle-bone and bronze forms it shows a sacred bird wearing a crested headpiece—the same numinous bird that underlies <span class="kanji-inline">鳳</span> (phoenix). The element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="凡.html">凡</a> was added as a marker for the Sino-Japanese reading. As ideas shifted toward dragons dwelling in the heavens and stirring the air, the bird of <span class="kanji-inline">鳳</span> was set aside and the reptile/dragon sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="虫.html">虫</a> was introduced, giving <span class="kanji-inline">風</span> its received form and the sense of wind. Thus the character does not depict moving air; it evokes a spirit-creature, bird- or dragon-like, that brings the wind. In antiquity the wind was imagined as a bird-shaped deity that ranged across the land, touching every place and shaping each region’s distinctive <span class="kanji-inline">風</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="俗.html">俗</a> (customs) and <span class="kanji-inline">風</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="物.html">物</a> (natural scenes and things).</p>
