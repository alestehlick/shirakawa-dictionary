    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">奔</span> is a compound graph that intensifies the image found in <span class="kanji-inline">走</span>. The upper element is the same as in <span class="kanji-inline">走</span>: a person leaning slightly forward, arms swinging as they run. The component <span class="kanji-inline">止</span> represents footprints, the act of going. By setting three <span class="kanji-inline">止</span> beneath that running figure, the character heightens the sense of movement and urgency—more emphatic than <span class="kanji-inline">走</span>, which adds only a single <span class="kanji-inline">止</span>. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">奔</span> came to mean running swiftly or dashing about. The compound <span class="kanji-inline">奔</span><span class="kanji-inline">走</span> originally evoked the busy scurrying performed during rites of worship, and by extension came to mean bustling around or rushing about.</p>
