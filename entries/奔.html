    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">奔</span> is a compound graph that intensifies the image found in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="走.html">走</a>. The upper element is the same as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="走.html">走</a>: a person leaning slightly forward, arms swinging as they run. The component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a> represents footprints, the act of going. By setting three <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a> beneath that running figure, the character heightens the sense of movement and urgency—more emphatic than <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="走.html">走</a>, which adds only a single <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a>. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">奔</span> came to mean running swiftly or dashing about. The compound <span class="kanji-inline">奔</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="走.html">走</a> originally evoked the busy scurrying performed during rites of worship, and by extension came to mean bustling around or rushing about.</p>
