    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">相</span> is a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> “tree” and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="目.html">目</a> “eye.” At heart it means to look upon a tree: gazing at a luxuriant, flourishing tree was thought to stir the soul and replenish the viewer’s vital energy. From this life-giving effect of looking, the character came to mean “to help,” and further, by implying an interaction between the vitality of what is seen and the observer, it developed the sense of “mutual, reciprocal.” It is also used for “appearance, figure” and, by extension, physiognomy. Classical poetry often treats the sight—or even the singing—of lush grasses and groves as an act that rouses the spirit and nourishes vitality, a sensibility echoed in Japanese verse that lingers over scenes one never tires of viewing; the related character <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="想.html">想</a> expresses thinking shaped by such recollective impressions.</p>
