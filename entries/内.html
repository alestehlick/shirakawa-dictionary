    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of an entryway: sturdy uprights set together with a roof above, marking the doorway of a building. By contrast, the graph for iru (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="入.html">入</a>) shows an entrance without a roof. In bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">内</span> often appears where one would expect <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="入.html">入</a>, as in writing “entering the gate” with <span class="kanji-inline">内</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="門.html">門</a>, emphasizing the act of going within. From this sense of having passed through a doorway, the character came to mean the inside or interior, and by extension the inward realm of the heart and mind, as seen in words like naishin (one’s inner feelings) and naisei (introspection).</p>
