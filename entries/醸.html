    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, originally written <span class="kanji-inline">釀</span>. It sets <span class="kanji-inline">酉</span>, the image of a wine cask, as the semantic base, and takes <span class="kanji-inline">襄</span> as the phonetic. Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">襄</span> as depicting paired ritual receptacles and curse implements arranged at the collar of a funerary garment—an image that suggests the chest swelling and rounding. With the wine-jar element indicating liquor and the phonetic carrying the idea of swelling and maturing, the graph came to mean the swelling of yeast and, by extension, brewing and the brewing of alcohol.</p>
