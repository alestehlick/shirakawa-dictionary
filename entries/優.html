    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">優</span> takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="憂.html">憂</a> as its phonetic, giving the on-reading yuu. In form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="憂.html">憂</a> depicts a mourner standing still with a mourning headpiece, absorbed in grief. <span class="kanji-inline">優</span> builds on that image, showing a person who imitates the mourner’s bearing and gestures—a ritual substitute who expressed lament before the gods on behalf of the bereaved at a funeral. From this role of performer arose the sense of an actor, seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="俳.html">俳</a><span class="kanji-inline">優</span>, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="俳.html">俳</a> picturing two performers in line. The composed, tender demeanor of the ritual mourner then broadened into everyday meanings such as gentle and kind, and by extension into senses of surpassing and excelling, even connoting superior or outstanding quality.</p>
