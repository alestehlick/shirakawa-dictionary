    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound form that sets <span class="kanji-inline">自</span>, the frontal outline of a nose, above <span class="kanji-inline">心</span>, the heart. The nose signals respiration; paired with the heart, it portrays the heart’s living state as shown by breath. From this core sense arise uses for breathing and sighing (as in daisoku/taisoku and tansoku). Because breath is the sign of life and growth, the meaning broadens to living and increasing (jisoku, seisoku), and by extension to interest—the increase accruing to money (risoku). It also comes to mean rest and to cease, as when one lays down a burden and takes a breath (sokuken), rests the body (kyusoku), is free from calamity and healthy (sokusai), or brings things to an end (shusoku).</p>
