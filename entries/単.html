    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form <span class="kanji-inline">單</span> is a pictograph of an oval shield topped with two feather ornaments; different tribes distinguished themselves by the patterns or adornments on their shields. From this shield, the graph <span class="kanji-inline">戦</span> arose by combining <span class="kanji-inline">單</span> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>, the pike, to show combat with shield and spear. As a military term, <span class="kanji-inline">單</span> denoted a single unit or troop—hence expressions like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="三.html">三</a><span class="kanji-inline">單</span> for three troops—and from that sense it broadened to mean the single or the one, as in being alone or one in number. In compounds it also came to express doing something to the utmost or exhausting one’s powers, and by extension the sense of the whole or entirety.</p>
