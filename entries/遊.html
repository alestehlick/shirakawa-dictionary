    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa understands <span class="kanji-inline">遊</span> as a picto-phonetic character built on <span class="kanji-inline">旃</span>, which combines a flagstaff with a fixed streamer and the figure of a person, depicting someone holding up the clan banner. Because the divine spirit was believed to dwell in that flag, <span class="kanji-inline">旃</span> originally meant to raise the banner and set out. From this base came <span class="kanji-inline">遊</span> and its variant <span class="kanji-inline">游</span>: the Shuowen explains <span class="kanji-inline">游</span> in terms of the hanging streamers of a flag (<span class="kanji-inline">旒</span>), while <span class="kanji-inline">遊</span> was formed by adding the walking element <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> to <span class="kanji-inline">旃</span> to express movement; a related form, <span class="kanji-inline">游</span>, later specialized in the sense “to swim.” In origin, then, <span class="kanji-inline">遊</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">游</span> evoked the untrammeled going of the indwelling spirit—the leisurely progress of the gods—and only later broadened to the human sense of play and carefree wandering.</p>
