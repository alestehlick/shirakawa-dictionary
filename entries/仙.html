    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees this as a picto‑phonetic graph. In its older form <span class="kanji-inline">僊</span>, a component shows the act of lifting and removing a corpse—head and lower body grasped with both hands—so that the body could be set for a time in a boarded enclosure to weather before burial; on that basis, <span class="kanji-inline">僊</span> originally named that person. The later form <span class="kanji-inline">仙</span> writes the word with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="山.html">山</a>, treated as a reading marker that also evokes the mountains, and the meaning shifts to a person who cultivates the Way in seclusion: a mountain ascetic or Daoist transcendent. The character is already noted in the Shiming (Explanation of Names) of the late Han.</p>
