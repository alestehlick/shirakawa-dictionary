    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">諾</span> is a phono-semantic character built with the speech element and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="若.html">若</a> as its phonetic core. Shirakawa reads <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="若.html">若</a> not merely as a sound sign but as the figure of a miko—a shamanic woman—raising both hands in dance, receiving a divine message in a state of repose. In oracle-bone inscriptions, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="若.html">若</a> itself appears with the sense later written as <span class="kanji-inline">諾</span>, showing that <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="若.html">若</a> was the original form and that the word denoted assent granted under divine sanction. From this sacred “yes”—consent that is permitted and approved—arose the nuances of agreeing, answering, and being compliant. The Book of Rites even distinguishes the tone of assent: when a father commands, one should not reply with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="唯.html">唯</a> (a simple “yes”) but with <span class="kanji-inline">諾</span>, the deferential, affirmative “yes.” From the core idea of permission and approval, the character also extended to mean to understand and to follow.</p>
