    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="竹.html">竹</a>, bamboo, and <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span>, the ancient figure of a hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>) grasping a brush. <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span> was originally the sign for a writing brush itself; by adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="竹.html">竹</a>, the material from which brushes were commonly made, the graph specifies the bamboo-handled writing brush and, by extension, writing with it. From the very beginnings of the script, brush tools were already in use: oracle-bone inscriptions preserve strokes laid down in red cinnabar or black, and bronze texts were first drafted with the brush before casting. The term <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a><span class="kanji-inline">筆</span> refers to the pairing of a writing brush with a small knife used to scrape corrections on bamboo or wooden slips, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a><span class="kanji-inline">筆</span>の<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="吏.html">吏</a> names the clerks whose work was devoted to writing.</p>
