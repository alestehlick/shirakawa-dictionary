    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines the fire element with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="欠.html">欠</a>, the figure of a standing person shown in profile with the mouth open. It depicts someone blowing breath onto a flame—sending air to revive and strengthen the fire—and by extension came to mean cooking: cooking rice, cooking in general, and simmering. The term also carries ritual resonance: in the Fengshan chapter of the Shiji, among the deities served by shamans appears a “First Cook” (Xian Chui, J. Sen Sui) of Jin, likely an early form of the later stove deity, underscoring the sacred role of tending the hearth.</p>
