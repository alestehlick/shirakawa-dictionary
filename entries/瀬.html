    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">瀬</span> is a phono-semantic character built with the water element and the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="賴.html">賴</a>/<span class="kanji-inline">頼</span>. Early sources gloss it as “water flowing over pebbles,” evoking the chattering, broken current that forms a river’s shallows and rapids. Shirakawa notes that <span class="kanji-inline">頼</span> itself seems to echo that lively sound, the same sound value that also appears in <span class="kanji-inline">籟</span>, a bamboo pipe with three holes. Through this shared sound, both <span class="kanji-inline">瀬</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">籟</span> carry the On reading rai. From the concrete image of a stony, shallow run of water, the word extends to places where a channel narrows—hence Seto for a strait—and figuratively to a decisive brink, as in setogiwa.</p>
