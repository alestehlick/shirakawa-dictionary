    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph, <span class="kanji-inline">稿</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span> “grain” with the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="高.html">高</a>. Shirakawa reads <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="高.html">高</a> as the image of a covenant coffer for depositing prayer texts to the gods, to which the withered upper bones of the dead are added—an image that lends connotations of condolence, pallor, and a smooth, calm surface. In early explanations, the ancient form <span class="kanji-inline">稾</span> is “wheat straw”; related <span class="kanji-inline">槁</span> describes wood that has withered and turned white, while <span class="kanji-inline">稾</span> denotes dried, lustrous straw. From this material sense, the character came to mean a draft or rough copy, because such preliminary writing was done on coarse straw paper, even in hurried strokes.</p>
