    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">猛</span> as a phono-semantic character: the dog radical <span class="kanji-inline">犭</span> supplies the field of meaning, while <span class="kanji-inline">孟</span> functions as the phonetic that signals the on-yomi mou. In early lexica it is defined concretely as a “fierce dog,” and related forms such as <span class="kanji-inline">獳</span> are glossed as the figure of an enraged dog; the binome <span class="kanji-inline">獳</span><span class="kanji-inline">猛</span> originally described a dog’s wild, violent temperament. From this vivid image the sense broadened to the general qualities of being fierce, strong, or vehement. Classical usage preserves this extension, as in the Book of Rites: <span class="kanji-inline">苛</span><span class="kanji-inline">政</span><span class="kanji-inline">猛</span><span class="kanji-inline">於</span><span class="kanji-inline">虎</span><span class="kanji-inline">也</span>—“oppressive rule is fiercer than a tiger.”</p>
