    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with the flesh radical (⺼) indicating bodily substance and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="方.html">方</a> as the phonetic. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="方.html">方</a> also carries the idea of things gathering in one place, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="房.html">房</a> “tuft,” which suits fat as something that collects within the body. The Shuowen glosses it as “to grow fat,” and the character came to denote solid fat at ordinary temperature—a nutritive substance—seen in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="脂.html">脂</a><span class="kanji-inline">肪</span>. Expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">肪</span><span class="kanji-inline">膩</span> describe the soft, oily smoothness of skin suffused with fat, once regarded as a hallmark of feminine beauty.</p>
