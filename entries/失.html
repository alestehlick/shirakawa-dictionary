    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest pictographic form, <span class="kanji-inline">失</span> shows a dancer with arms flung upward, the figure of a female shaman leaping in ritual to the point of self-forgetfulness. From this image of trance—literally losing one’s awareness—the meaning broadened to losing something in general. Related graphs trace other facets of the same ecstatic rite: <span class="kanji-inline">佚</span> depicts relaxed enjoyment, <span class="kanji-inline">夭</span> portrays a shaman’s head inclined and body sinuously twisting (the basis of <span class="kanji-inline">妖</span>), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="迭.html">迭</a> evokes the alternation between low and exalted, frenzied movements. In later usage, <span class="kanji-inline">失</span> naturally extended to errors and mishaps, as seen in compounds like kashitsu (error) and shikka (accidental fire).</p>
