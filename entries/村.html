    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph. The element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a> serves as the phonetic, giving the on-yomi son (as in <span class="kanji-inline">忖</span> “to gauge”). In earlier times the word was written <span class="kanji-inline">邨</span>, a form composed of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="屯.html">屯</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">邑</span>. Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">邑</span> as a picture of a walled enclosure with a kneeling person within, expressing people gathered inside fortifications and, by extension, meanings such as capital, town, and village. From the Eastern Jin period onward—already seen in Tao Yuanming’s writings—the form <span class="kanji-inline">村</span> came into use and thereafter became the customary character for “village.”</p>
