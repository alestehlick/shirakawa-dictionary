    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The original form <span class="kanji-inline">屬</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尾.html">尾</a>, the image of an animal with its tail stretched out (marking the female), with <span class="kanji-inline">蜀</span>, a male animal whose inner <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="虫.html">虫</a> graph depicts the male organ. The picture is of male and female joining, and from this concrete union the character broadened to mean things ranging in a row, continuing in sequence, and being linked or connected. By extension it came to express sticking or adhering, drawing near, and attachment in the social sense—belonging to a group or being left in someone’s charge. The derivative <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="嘱.html">嘱</a> (traditional <span class="kanji-inline">囑</span>), with the mouth element added, channels this idea into the act of requesting or entrusting by speech.</p>
