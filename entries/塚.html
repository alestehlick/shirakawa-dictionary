    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the soil radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> gives the sense of earth, while <span class="kanji-inline">冢</span> (on reading cho) supplies the sound. The ancient form <span class="kanji-inline">冢</span> depicts a castrated dog slain as a sacrificial offering and interred with a mound heaped above; this original graph carried the meanings “mound, hillock” and “grave.” The later form <span class="kanji-inline">塚</span>, current since the Tang, is the popular written shape. In ritual usage, <span class="kanji-inline">冢</span> could also denote a shrine or grand shrine, and by extension the eldest son as heir to the ancestral charge. The same ritual image explains <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="家.html">家</a>: placing the sacrificed dog beneath the roof that marks the ancestral hall yields the character for “house.”</p>
