    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">進</span> is a phono-semantic character: the movement radical <span class="kanji-inline">辶</span> signals going or proceeding, while <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span> depicts a small bird and supplies the sound. In early usage it evoked the commander’s decision point—whether to advance or withdraw the army—made after observing omens and then ordering the troops forward. The bird component reflects the reading of avian signs, like the tail-wagging wagtail in the Book of Odes (Minor Odes, “Chang Di”), taken as a sudden portent in times of distress. From this sense of proceeding in response to such signs, the character came to mean to advance, and by extension to promote or to recommend.</p>
