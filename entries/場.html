    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">場</span> is a phono-semantic character: the left component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> marks the ground, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="易.html">易</a> supplies the sound and a resonant idea. In Shirakawa’s reading, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="易.html">易</a> depicts a piece of jade set on a pedestal, its radiance streaming downward—an image tied to the rite of tamafuri, the “shaking of the spirit,” in which jade was believed to quicken human vitality. <span class="kanji-inline">場</span> thus originally named the ground set apart for such ceremonies, the sacred precinct where deities were revered—the festival yard (matsuri no niwa). From this sense of a consecrated site, the meaning broadened to a harvest field, an empty lot, and, more generally, any place or locale.</p>
