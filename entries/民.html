    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">民</span> depicts an eye being pierced—a vivid sign of blinding. From this image, the character first referred to a person whose sight had been taken and who served as an attendant in sacred rites. The same background informs <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="臣.html">臣</a>, likewise a blinded attendant to the gods; together they later formed <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="臣.html">臣</a><span class="kanji-inline">民</span>, “subjects,” those who follow a lord. Over time, <span class="kanji-inline">民</span> shed its ritual nuance and came to mean the people at large, and by extension simply “a person.”</p>
