    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines the form of a tree branch with the hand <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>, picturing a branch grasped as a support—a scene that stands at the origin of the later graph <span class="kanji-inline">杖</span>, “cane.” The cross-shaped element here is not the numeral ‘ten’ but the branch itself. Although it uses the same parts as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="支.html">支</a>, they are joined in a different way. From measuring with a staff, the graph came to signify a unit of length equal to ten shaku (about three meters), as in the Zuo Zhuan’s phrase <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="巡.html">巡</a><span class="kanji-inline">丈</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="城.html">城</a>, “to go around and take the measure of a fortress.” By extension, <span class="kanji-inline">丈</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="人.html">人</a> names a mature adult, sometimes explained as one of thirty years.</p>
