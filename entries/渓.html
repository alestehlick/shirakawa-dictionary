    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">溪</span> and also seen as <span class="kanji-inline">谿</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the water element marks a stream, while <span class="kanji-inline">奚</span> supplies the sound kei and subtly contributes a sense of something thinned or narrow—likely alluding to a men’s hairstyle in which the hair around the crown is shaved, with a thin central braid left to hang down. The graph thus names the narrow watercourse between mountains, a clear ravine or mountain stream. Because such waters were regarded as pure, water and streamside grasses from these valleys were offered in ritual; old writings even record presenting water plants gathered from the muddy pools along a mountain brook (<span class="kanji-inline">澗</span><span class="kanji-inline">溪</span>) to the gods.</p>
