    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains the original form <span class="kanji-inline">劑</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">齊</span> (here an abbreviation of <span class="kanji-inline">齋</span>, standing for a square bronze ding vessel) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a>, the knife. <span class="kanji-inline">齊</span> names the ritual vessel that bore formal inscriptions, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a> indicates the act of carving words into its side. From this, <span class="kanji-inline">劑</span> first meant to cut an inscription on a bronze tripod to seal an agreement, and by extension the inscribed agreement itself—the contract, its document, or the tally used to authenticate a deal. The Rites of Zhou describes such market procedures in which transactions were fixed by carvings on a bronze ding. Later the sense shifted to prepared mixtures, giving the modern meanings “medicine,” “dose,” and related pharmaceutical agents.</p>
