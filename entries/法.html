    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains that the original form was <span class="kanji-inline">灋</span>, built from the water sign, the sacred beast <span class="kanji-inline">廌</span> (a sheep-like “ordeal animal” used in trials), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="去.html">去</a>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="去.html">去</a> combines a figure with outstretched limbs (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>) and an open covenant vessel (<span class="kanji-inline">凵</span>) whose lid has been removed, signaling that a false oath has been exposed. In ancient adjudication, parties swore before the gods and underwent divine ordeal; when guilt was revealed, the loser was expelled—cast into the waters—together with the ordeal beast and the invalidated covenant chest. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">灋</span> first meant to discard or banish, a sense reflected in bronze texts such as <span class="kanji-inline">勿</span><span class="kanji-inline">灋</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="朕.html">朕</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a>, “Do not cast away my command.” Later the <span class="kanji-inline">廌</span> component was abbreviated to yield <span class="kanji-inline">法</span>, which came to signify the rule to be followed—law and regulation—and by extension following a rule and the means or method for doing so.</p>
