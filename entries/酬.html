    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">酬</span> is a phono-semantic character: the wine jar element <span class="kanji-inline">酉</span> points to the world of drinking rites, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="州.html">州</a> supplies the sound shuu. In the Shuowen it also appears as the older form <span class="kanji-inline">醻</span>, written with <span class="kanji-inline">壽</span> as the phonetic, another spelling that confirms the same reading. In early usage, as in the Book of Odes phrase <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="献.html">献</a><span class="kanji-inline">酬</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="交.html">交</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="錯.html">錯</a>, it referred to the exchanging of cups at a banquet—presenting a drink and returning one in turn. From this ritual act of offering a cup in return, the sense broadened to reciprocate and reply, and further to reward or compensate, as reflected in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="応.html">応</a><span class="kanji-inline">酬</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="報.html">報</a><span class="kanji-inline">酬</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">酬</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="恩.html">恩</a>.</p>
