    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">壇</span> is a phono-semantic character: the left element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> points to heaped earth, while the right element <span class="kanji-inline">亶</span> supplies the sound and originally depicted a granary structure raised on an earthen podium—the base of a building. From this imagery arose <span class="kanji-inline">壇</span> as the figure of a raised earthen place prepared for worship. Shuowen glosses it as an altar for worship, that is, a stage of packed soil set apart as sacred ground. Hence expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">壇</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="場.html">場</a> (danjo) evoke the consecrated, leveled area where rites and festivals were conducted, a place for approaching the gods.</p>
