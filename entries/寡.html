    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This graph combines the shrine roof <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span> with a human figure <span class="kanji-inline">人</span> and the head <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span>. It pictures a mourner seen in profile within an ancestral mausoleum, a ritual headband tied around the head, paying respects to the departed—some old forms even show tears flowing. From this image it came to mean a widow; the Book of Rites glosses <span class="kanji-inline">寡</span> as “old and without a husband.” Together with <span class="kanji-inline">鰥</span> (widower), <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="孤.html">孤</a> (orphan), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="独.html">独</a> (the aged without children), it designated those bereft and thus in need of care. Because a widow was thought of as “one with little fortune,” the sense broadened to “few, scant,” and by extension “weak, small.” In classical usage rulers styled themselves modestly as <span class="kanji-inline">寡</span><span class="kanji-inline">人</span>, “my poor self.” The on reading ka stands close in feel to the ko of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="孤.html">孤</a>, and the character also carries overtones of solitude.</p>
