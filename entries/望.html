    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the oracle-bone script, the graph shows an eye with an enlarged pupil (the form later written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="臣.html">臣</a>) set above a person in profile standing on tiptoe (shaped like <span class="kanji-inline">壬</span>): a figure craning upward to see far into the distance. Later, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="亡.html">亡</a> added as the phonetic element supplying the on-reading, the character took the form <span class="kanji-inline">望</span>. From the act of searching and sighting afar, its sense broadened to hope, wish, expect, and look forward to. The poised stance and powerful gaze recall ancient practices of cloud- and weather-watching and divination, as well as the believed malefic force of the eye that could subdue enemies. Oracle-bone texts even record the clan name <span class="kanji-inline">望</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="乗.html">乗</a> (Wangcheng/Bōjō), likely a group that accompanied armies, charged with discerning the enemy’s condition through the potency of that vigilant gaze.</p>
