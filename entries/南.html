    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">南</span> as a pictograph of a suspended bronze drum: a bottomless metal drum hung by a cord threaded through a ring at the top, an instrument used by the Miao people who lived along the middle Yangtze from Wuhan to Hunan. Oracle-bone texts even show a graph read nan depicting the act of striking this drum. The shape of <span class="kanji-inline">南</span> captures the cord and the body of the hanging instrument, and the Miao still call such a drum nánrèn. Only later was the graph’s on reading borrowed to write the compass direction “south,” just as other direction names came to be written by phonetic loans.</p>
