    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">募</span> is a phonetic–semantic character formed from <span class="kanji-inline">莫</span> above <span class="kanji-inline">力</span>. <span class="kanji-inline">莫</span> functions as the phonetic, signaling the on-reading bo, and also resonates with the sense of <span class="kanji-inline">摸</span>, to seek or take broadly, implying a wide-ranging call. The lower <span class="kanji-inline">力</span>, understood here as the form of a plow, evokes agricultural labor. Together they depict calling for and gathering people—originally recruiting hands for farm work—and by extension came to mean to recruit, solicit, or raise support.</p>
