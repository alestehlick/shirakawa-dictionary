    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">許</span> as a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> represents the words or prayers offered, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="午.html">午</a> serves as the phonetic element. In archaic forms the graph later written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="午.html">午</a> did not mean “noon,” but depicted a twisted ritual bundle (yo), a fetish believed to hold spiritual power; it was later stylized like a mallet (kine). This sacred implement was set up and venerated, prayers were addressed to it, and the deity was invoked to descend, accept, and grant them. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">許</span> first expressed the gods’ granting of a petition—permission—and only later broadened to the general senses of permitting, admitting, or allowing. The phonetic value of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="午.html">午</a> also resonates with the reading of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="御.html">御</a> (gyo), an older graph written with the same element, which helps account for the on reading.</p>
