    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the left side is the tree radical, signaling a kind of tree, while the right side is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="公.html">公</a>, which serves as the phonetic and gives the on-yomi shou, as in the characters for “to praise” and “to litigate.” The primary sense is the pine—an evergreen with many nodes and a tall, upright bearing, long cherished as auspicious. The Book of Odes invokes it in celebratory imagery—“as luxuriant as the pine,” and “like the luxuriance of the pine and cypress”—so from early times the pine was a symbol of felicity and praise.</p>
