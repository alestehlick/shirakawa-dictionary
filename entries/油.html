    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the water element combines with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="由.html">由</a>, which serves as the phonetic and points to the on reading. Shirakawa traces <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="由.html">由</a> back to an older form <span class="kanji-inline">卣</span>, the image of a gourd-like vessel whose seeds have ripened and dissolved, leaving the rind hollow. From this association with ripened seeds that yield an expressed liquid, <span class="kanji-inline">油</span> came to denote the oil obtained from seeds—that is, vegetable oil. Because oily substances produce a sheen, the graph also developed the sense of an oily state and, by extension, gloss or luster. In contrast, <span class="kanji-inline">膏</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">脂</span> belong to animal fat.</p>
