    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a right hand with its fingers extended, and in that sense it was the original graph later differentiated as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="右.html">右</a> “right.” In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions it often functions with the sense of “to have, to exist,” a usage that aligns with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="有.html">有</a>. Over time its everyday meanings shifted toward “again” and “twice,” and it could also convey the idea of “to help.” Once <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="右.html">右</a> was established for the specific meaning “right,” this graph carried the newer senses, while its counterpart for the left hand was the form ナ, which became the basis of <span class="kanji-inline">左</span>.</p>
