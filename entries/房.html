    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">房</span> is a phono-semantic character built with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="方.html">方</a> as its phonetic element, the graph that suggests spaces divided into square sections. The Shuowen glosses it as “a side room,” a compartment set along the flank of a building, and from there it came to mean an inner room or chamber and, by extension, a dwelling itself, as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">房</span><span class="kanji-inline">舎</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="僧.html">僧</a><span class="kanji-inline">房</span>. In Japanese it also preserves a concrete image of things gathered in bunches, yielding the kun reading fusa “tuft, tassel,” familiar in words such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="花.html">花</a><span class="kanji-inline">房</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="乳.html">乳</a><span class="kanji-inline">房</span>.</p>
