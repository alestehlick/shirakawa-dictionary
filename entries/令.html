    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a person kneeling beneath a deep ceremonial cap, receiving a divine message. It therefore signifies a revelation from the gods and, by extension, the edict or command issued by the Son of Heaven or other superiors. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions <span class="kanji-inline">令</span> is used in the sense later written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a>, and indeed served as the original graph for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a>. From the notion of heeding the divine will it also developed the meaning “good, fine,” and in Japanese it further came to function with the causative force seen in -shimu, eventually being used independently apart from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a>.</p>
