    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its early form, this character is a compound of two instances of <span class="kanji-inline">屮</span>, the figure of a sprouting plant, set with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="斤.html">斤</a>, an axe. It pictures cutting plants or trees with an axe, which gives the basic senses “to cut off” and “to break.” From the ritual act of swearing—marked by cutting greenery or breaking an arrow—arose the related idea of oath-taking, seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="誓.html">誓</a>, the declaring of words of oath to the deities. In Japanese, ori also came to mean a fitting time or occasion and a small wooden gift box, as in kashiori (a box of sweets), tokiori (“at times”), and ori ni furete (“from time to time”).</p>
