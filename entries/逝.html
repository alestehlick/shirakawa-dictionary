    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">逝</span> is a phono-semantic character: the movement radical <span class="kanji-inline">辶</span> signals the idea of going, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="折.html">折</a> serves as the phonetic, guiding the on reading sei (compare <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="誓.html">誓</a>). In the Shuowen it is glossed as “to go,” and in early usage it simply meant to proceed or to be present, as seen in classical citations such as the Book of Documents (Da Gao): <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="昔.html">昔</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="朕.html">朕</a><span class="kanji-inline">其</span><span class="kanji-inline">逝</span>, and in the Book of Poetry (Minor Odes, Xiao Bian), where it is used with the sense “to go/approach.” From this basic notion of moving on, it later became a respectful term for dying, and it can also be applied beyond persons, as in <span class="kanji-inline">逝</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="水.html">水</a>, “waters that flow away.”</p>
