    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">議</span> is a phono-semantic character formed with <span class="kanji-inline">言</span>, the element of speech, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="義.html">義</a> as the sound. In Shirakawa’s reading, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="義.html">義</a> originally signified the certifying of a sacrificial sheep as flawless—hence what is correct—and this ritual backdrop colors <span class="kanji-inline">議</span>. The earliest sense was hakaru: to take counsel, specifically to consult with the gods in order to arrive at what is right. From that sacred act of consultation grew the broader meanings of deliberation and discussion; the same nuance lies behind compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="謀.html">謀</a><span class="kanji-inline">議</span>. A Shinto norito preserves this atmosphere in the phrase <span class="kanji-inline">神</span><span class="kanji-inline">議</span>りに<span class="kanji-inline">議</span>りたまひて, “to consult as one consults with the gods,” where hakaru captures the solemn act of seeking divine counsel.</p>
