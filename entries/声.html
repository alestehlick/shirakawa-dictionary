    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">聲</span>, the graph shows a suspended stone chime (<span class="kanji-inline">磬</span>) being struck, set beside an ear to depict sound as it is heard. In oracle-bone and bronze forms a small “sai” element appears below—the shape of a ritual receptacle that held covenant texts offered to the gods—indicating a prayerful summons and revealing that the chime served to call the deities. From this scene the character first meant sound and echo; later it came to denote the human voice and, by extension, rumor.</p>
