    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Under the <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span> roof, which depicts the ancestral mausoleum, stands <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="番.html">番</a>, here understood as born from a claw-like element shaped like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="米.html">米</a> joined with a hand or palm. This combination evokes the sacrificial paw presented in the shrine. Because such offerings had to be flawless, the scene suggests the act of scrutinizing the paw for any injury or imperfection. From this ritual of exacting inspection, <span class="kanji-inline">審</span> comes to mean to examine thoroughly, to render things detailed and clear.</p>
