    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the bamboo radical points to the original material, while <span class="kanji-inline">固</span> serves as the phonetic element that marks the Sino-Japanese reading. The Shuowen explains it as naming a piece of bamboo, something like a bamboo spatula; because such pieces were set out in rows when tallying, the graph came to signify a counting unit and was used for enumerating items (as in “one item,” “two items”). In later usage it appears in abbreviated counter forms such as <span class="kanji-inline">个</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">介</span>: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="一.html">一</a><span class="kanji-inline">介</span> was used specifically for counting persons, whereas <span class="kanji-inline">個</span>—formed with the person radical—came to be used exclusively for counting things.</p>
