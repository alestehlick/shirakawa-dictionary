    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">僕</span> takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="業.html">業</a> as its phonetic, yielding the boku sound shared by characters such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="撲.html">撲</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">樸</span>. In bronze inscriptions it depicts a person wearing a ceremonial headpiece after a rite—an attendant serving the gods. An old-script form follows the pattern of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="臣.html">臣</a>, which likewise originally showed one in service to the divine. From this origin the sense shifted to a general “servant,” specifically a “male servant,” and in time it became a humble first-person term; Sima Qian famously uses <span class="kanji-inline">僕</span> to refer to himself in his letter to Ren An.</p>
