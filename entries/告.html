    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally a pictograph, <span class="kanji-inline">告</span> depicts a small branch set upon a ritual container known as a sai, a covenant vessel that held written petitions to the gods. The scene is that of presenting this adorned vessel before the deities to pray and make a formal announcement. From this sacred act of petitioning, the sense naturally broadened to reporting or informing those of higher rank. The related character <span class="kanji-inline">誥</span> marks a king’s command conveyed through this same ritual medium, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="史.html">史</a> shows the sacred object fixed to a wooden post for prayer and worship, anchoring <span class="kanji-inline">告</span> in the sphere of ritual proclamation and written supplication.</p>
