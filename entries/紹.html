    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">紹</span> as a phono-semantic graph with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="召.html">召</a> providing the sound (On sho). In bronze inscriptions it appears in phrases like <span class="kanji-inline">紹</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="種.html">種</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皇.html">皇</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="祖.html">祖</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="皇.html">皇</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="帝.html">帝</a>, “to continue the line of the imperial ancestors,” expressing the idea of following the founders’ path and inheriting their office; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="種.html">種</a> here carries the sense of lineage and succession. Early bronze forms also write the character as <span class="kanji-inline">邵</span>: the element <span class="kanji-inline">卩</span> depicts a kneeling worshiper, set beside a ritual ‘sai,’ a covenant vessel that receives written prayers to the gods. The scene is one of reverent offering to invite the descent of the departed spirit and to meet it, and from this ritual context the character’s core meanings—succession and accession—arise. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">紹</span> comes to mean to carry on or take over, and, by extension, to introduce or link on another’s behalf.</p>
