    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The ancient graph sketches a tree with branch tips thrusting out luxuriantly. From this image come derivatives: with the knife element it forms <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="制.html">制</a>, the pruning or trimming of those outgrowing branches, and with the clothing element it forms <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="製.html">製</a>, cutting cloth and tailoring. The familiar sense “not yet” (imada, often with a negative) is a later phonetic loan based on the character’s sound. The graph also serves as the name of the eighth Earthly Branch, traditionally associated with the sheep.</p>
