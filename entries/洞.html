    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character with the water element and the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="同.html">同</a> (dou). Shirakawa explains that <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="同.html">同</a> originally depicted a tubular wine vessel and thus conveyed the idea of a tube-like form. While the Shuowen glossed the character as describing swiftly flowing water, he sees the older sense as “cave” or “hollow,” a tubular cavity often carved by the force of water and therefore deep. From this image of a cave or den, the character naturally extends to meanings such as to pass through, to penetrate, and deep.</p>
