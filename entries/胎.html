    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the left-side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="月.html">月</a> (nikuzuki) marks a part of the human body, while <span class="kanji-inline">台</span> serves as the phonetic and evokes a ritual scene. In that rite, a plow (ム) was purified and, together with a covenant vessel (sai) that held written prayers to the gods, offered in supplication for a rich harvest. Human birth was imagined in parallel with the sprouting of crops, so the same purification and offering were performed when praying for conception (jutai). From this association, <span class="kanji-inline">胎</span> came to mean to become pregnant and the womb itself. Relatedly, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="始.html">始</a> depicts a woman’s prayer for safe delivery with the plow and covenant vessel, and an ode in the Book of Odes on gathering plantain—an herb auspicious for childbearing—preserves the compound <span class="kanji-inline">胚</span><span class="kanji-inline">胎</span>, “gestation.”</p>
