    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">神</span> is a phono-semantic character. Its phonetic, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="申.html">申</a>, originally pictured a flash of lightning, and because a lightning bolt was felt as the sudden manifestation of divine authority, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="申.html">申</a> itself was used in bronze inscriptions with the meaning of “kami” and was the original graph for this idea. When <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="申.html">申</a> later came to be used for the polite verb “to say,” the altar sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a> was added to fix the older religious sense, yielding <span class="kanji-inline">神</span>. Many characters built with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a> (the altar) belong to this sacred sphere, such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="社.html">社</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">祠</span>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="祖.html">祖</a>. In early usage <span class="kanji-inline">神</span> referred to nature deities and the veneration of natural forces and things; bronze texts also show ancestral spirits coming to be revered as gods. In later extensions it could denote the heart and its workings, or a person of outstanding mental powers.</p>
