    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">的</span> as a phono-semantic character whose earliest form is <span class="kanji-inline">昀</span>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勺.html">勺</a> functions as the phonetic element that signals the On reading teki, a value shared by other graphs built with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勺.html">勺</a>. Early lexica gloss it as “to become clear,” and the reduplicated form <span class="kanji-inline">昀</span><span class="kanji-inline">昀</span> (tekiteki) describes a state of evident clarity; hence its use for meanings such as akiraka “clear” and hakkiri “distinctly.” <span class="kanji-inline">的</span> later became the prevailing written form of this graph. In subsequent usage it was also applied to the concrete sense of a shooting target, giving the kun reading mato and appearing in compounds like shateki “target practice.”</p>
