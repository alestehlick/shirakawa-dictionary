    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats this as a phono-semantic character. Its original form was written <span class="kanji-inline">輭</span>, with <span class="kanji-inline">耎</span> serving as the phonetic indicator and already carrying the senses of &quot;soft&quot; and &quot;weak.&quot; He interprets <span class="kanji-inline">耎</span> as the front-facing figure of a shaman, hair cut short and without a topknot—a person who serves the gods—whose form here intimates pliancy. In established usage the on-reading settled as nan, and the form <span class="kanji-inline">軟</span> came to be used for &quot;soft, tender, flexible&quot; and by extension &quot;weak.&quot;</p>
