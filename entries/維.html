    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">維</span> is a phono-semantic character. The silk radical <span class="kanji-inline">糸</span> points to threadwork, while <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span> functions as the phonetic, giving the on reading i, as in related characters like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="唯.html">唯</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">帷</span>. Its original image is of fibers twisted into a strong cord—hence meanings such as rope and the acts of binding or tying—and by extension the idea of fiber itself, as in <span class="kanji-inline">繊</span><span class="kanji-inline">維</span>. In classical diction it can also serve as an adverbial particle meaning “just so/thereby,” a nuance that lives on in <span class="kanji-inline">維</span><span class="kanji-inline">新</span> “renewal, restoration,” a phrase celebrated from the Book of Odes (Major Odes, King Wen): “its mandate was renewed.”</p>
