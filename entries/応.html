    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">應</span>, this is a phono‑semantic character. Its key element, identified here as <span class="kanji-inline">雁</span> (serving as the on‑reading indicator for ō), depicts a person pressing a bird (<span class="kanji-inline">隹</span>, specifically a hawk) to the breast (<span class="kanji-inline">膺</span>), an image of hawk‑hunting. In Japan this solemn hunt, called ukeigari, was performed as a form of divination to question the gods; the outcome was received as a revelation. From that ritual setting grew the sense of “respond,” understood first as the deity’s answer to inquiry. Because the component supplies both sound and this ritual‑semantic associations, the character is an example of <span class="kanji-inline">亦</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="声.html">声</a>, where a phonetic also carries meaning.</p>
