    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">殘</span>, this is a phono-semantic character. The semantic element is <span class="kanji-inline">歹</span>, an ancient form depicting the upper part of a human skeleton—bones that are left behind. The phonetic element <span class="kanji-inline">戔</span> shows pikes (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>) heaped up in thin, small layers, and lends the on-reading while also suggesting a piling, fragmenting action. Together they evoke the few dismembered bones that remain after violent cutting or devouring. From this image arise the senses “to remain, to be left,” and by extension “to spoil, to harm,” and “cruel,” as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">残</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="虐.html">虐</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">残</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="酷.html">酷</a>, which picture the aftermath of scattered remains.</p>
