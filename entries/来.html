    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally this graph was a pictograph of a barley stalk, shown upright from the side. The Shuowen notes that in Zhou times it evoked the receiving of “auspicious barley” and wheat, echoing the legend of Hòu Ji, the Zhou agriculture deity, who was gifted blessed grain and thereby brought prosperity to the realm. In the oracle-bone inscriptions the graph was also borrowed for its sound to write the verbs “to come” and “to bring.” Later, writers differentiated these senses with related characters: <span class="kanji-inline">徠</span> for “to come” and <span class="kanji-inline">賚</span> for “to bestow.” Thus the familiar meaning “to come” arose by phonetic loan from a sign that first pictured bountiful grain.</p>
