    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a phono-semantic graph centered on <span class="kanji-inline">筑</span> as its phonetic core. In <span class="kanji-inline">筑</span>, the lower element depicts gripping a tool firmly with both hands, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="竹.html">竹</a> evokes a bamboo framework or cage. Together they picture ramming earth or clay into a frame and compacting it with a tool to form a solid foundation. <span class="kanji-inline">筑</span> thus underlies <span class="kanji-inline">築</span>; the later addition of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>, “wood,” points to the technique of hanchiku (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="版.html">版</a><span class="kanji-inline">築</span>), tamping soil between wooden boards. From this concrete image of building up earthen walls, the character came to mean to build, construct, and erect.</p>
