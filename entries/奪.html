    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">奪</span> as a figure built from the upper half of the garment sign <span class="kanji-inline">衣</span> (rendered as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>), the bird <span class="kanji-inline">隹</span>, and the hand <span class="kanji-inline">又</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a>, a composition clearly shown in bronze inscriptions. It depicts a hand reaching into clothing to catch a bird trying to escape, an image he connects with a funerary rite to keep the bird‑shaped soul from fleeing the deceased’s garments. From this act arise the senses “to catch,” “to seize,” and by extension “to take by force” or “to rob.” He compares it with <span class="kanji-inline">奮</span>, which shows the bird’s legs pinned by a device (the <span class="kanji-inline">田</span> element) to hold it within the garment; the bird’s struggle there yields meanings like “to flutter” and “to rouse, brandish.”</p>
