    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">研</span> is a phono-semantic character. The stone element conveys grinding and working stone, while the phonetic element written as <span class="kanji-inline">开</span>—also seen in characters like <span class="kanji-inline">妍</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">訝</span> and originally the graph for <span class="kanji-inline">笄</span>, a slender hairpin like a chopstick used to smooth hair—supplies the sound and suggests something finely polished, often in ivory or silver. Because hard stones are used to polish such objects, <span class="kanji-inline">研</span> came to mean polishing and sharpening, and by extension precise finishing and mastery. In earlier usage, <span class="kanji-inline">研</span> was also written where the later character <span class="kanji-inline">硯</span> (the inkstone for preparing ink) is now used.</p>
