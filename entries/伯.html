    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="白.html">白</a> element in <span class="kanji-inline">伯</span> as the on-reading indicator for haku and traces its form to a skull, bleached white as wind and rain stripped away the flesh. In antiquity, the skulls of eminent leaders or defeated enemy chiefs were preserved as white-bone relics, thought to retain powerful spiritual—indeed, curse-like—force. From this veneration of the head of an outstanding person, <span class="kanji-inline">伯</span> came to mean “head, chief,” and in the Zhou system of sibling order it denoted the eldest brother (<span class="kanji-inline">伯</span>, followed by <span class="kanji-inline">仲</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">叔</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">季</span>). The character thus extends to compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">伯</span><span class="kanji-inline">父</span>, referring to an elder uncle, and underlies later titles such as the noble “count.”</p>
