    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="任.html">任</a> as the phonetic element signaling the Sino-Japanese reading; in the Shuowen it is glossed as “to employ.” It denotes engaging people and paying them money as compensation for their work—hence words for wages. Beyond hiring, its use extends to borrowing or renting for a fee, as seen in compounds like chintaku, “a rented house.”</p>
