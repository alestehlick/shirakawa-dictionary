    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">慌</span> as a phono-semantic character: the heart radical signals an inner, emotional state, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="荒.html">荒</a> functions as the phonetic, giving the on reading kō. In his view, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="荒.html">荒</a> originally evoked the disheveled hair of a corpse cast into the weeds, a grim image that came to stand for devastation and famine, as seen in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="荒.html">荒</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="凶.html">凶</a> and in terms for a bad harvest year such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="荒.html">荒</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="歳.html">歳</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="荒.html">荒</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="年.html">年</a>. Against that backdrop, <span class="kanji-inline">慌</span> depicts a heart thrown into turmoil by danger directly before one’s eyes—hence the sense of being flurried or panicked, and its role in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="恐.html">恐</a><span class="kanji-inline">慌</span> for widespread panic, including economic upheaval. In classical usage the word also shades into trance-like absorption or vacant confusion, as in <span class="kanji-inline">慌</span><span class="kanji-inline">忽</span> and its variant <span class="kanji-inline">恍</span><span class="kanji-inline">惚</span> for rapture, and <span class="kanji-inline">慌</span><span class="kanji-inline">罔</span> for becoming bewildered and absent-minded.</p>
