    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">京</span> as a pictograph of a grand fortress gate with an arched passage and a lookout tower above. The profile of this gate is visible in the oracle-bone and bronze forms. Because such a monumental gate guarded the inner city, the character came to mean the capital and, by extension, something great or large. The term keikan (<span class="kanji-inline">京</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="観.html">観</a>) evokes this imposing gate. In ancient ritual practice, the gate itself could serve as a powerful apotropaic boundary: remains from the battlefield were sealed into the structure to form a curse barrier, much as temple sanmon gates later marked a threshold against the outer world.</p>
