    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">歩</span> as a compound of two footprint signs: <span class="kanji-inline">止</span>, the standard footprint, paired with <span class="kanji-inline">少</span>, which in its earliest form mirrors <span class="kanji-inline">止</span>. Early graphs set a left footprint with a right one behind it, and conversely a right with a left behind, vividly showing the alternating motion of the legs. From this image the character comes to mean walking, going, and a single step. In ancient ritual thinking, to place one’s feet on the ground and walk was to make contact with the spirit of the local soil; approaching important ceremonial sites on foot was therefore an act of respect toward that earth spirit.</p>
