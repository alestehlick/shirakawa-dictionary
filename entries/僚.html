    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the person radical on the left marks a human agent, while the right side is <span class="kanji-inline">尞</span>/<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寮.html">寮</a>, which supplies the sound ryō and evokes stacked wood set alight—a watch fire used during night guard, as in the courtyard beacon <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="庭.html">庭</a><span class="kanji-inline">燎</span>. From this imagery, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寮.html">寮</a> came to denote the sacred office where such a watch fire was maintained. With the person element added, <span class="kanji-inline">僚</span> originally named someone who served in that office, and by extension came to mean an official or a colleague sharing the same duties. The Book of Documents uses <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="百.html">百</a><span class="kanji-inline">僚</span>, “the hundred officials,” as a collective term for the bureaucracy.</p>
