    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its original form <span class="kanji-inline">專</span>, the character combines <span class="kanji-inline">惠</span>, the image of a tied sack filled with goods, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a>, the hand. It depicts putting things into the sack and pounding and compressing them by hand until they gather into a single mass, which gave early senses like “to roll up” and “to pound together.” From this core image, related graphs develop: <span class="kanji-inline">團</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="団.html">団</a>) shows the contents compacted within an enclosure into a rounded whole; <span class="kanji-inline">摶</span> expresses shaping by hand into a ball; <span class="kanji-inline">塼</span> names earth pressed and fired into a brick or tile. By extension—doing nothing but pounding and packing—the character came to mean “solely, exclusively,” and from there “to monopolize, to concentrate.”</p>
