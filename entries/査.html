    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa treats <span class="kanji-inline">査</span> as a phono-semantic character: the component <span class="kanji-inline">且</span> serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading sa, while the graph originally appeared as <span class="kanji-inline">楂</span>, the name of a tree identified with a small Japanese quince. That tree-name graph could also stand in place of <span class="kanji-inline">槎</span> and even carry the sense of “raft.” From these early concrete usages, its meaning broadened: the Ming-era Zhengzitong already glossed it in the vein of <span class="kanji-inline">察</span>, “to consider and examine,” and today it is used in the sense “to investigate, examine.”</p>
