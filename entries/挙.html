    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Now written <span class="kanji-inline">挙</span> and formerly <span class="kanji-inline">擧</span>, the character combines <span class="kanji-inline">與</span> (the older form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="与.html">与</a>) with the hand element. <span class="kanji-inline">與</span> depicts a pair of elephant tusks borne on four supporting hands, an image of carrying together, acting in concert. By adding yet more hands and showing the tusks lifted high, <span class="kanji-inline">挙</span> comes to mean raising or offering up. From this, compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">挙</span><span class="kanji-inline">行</span> evoke the offering of things and the conducting of rites or formal functions, and more broadly the carrying out of actions. Because the scene is one of many hands working as one, the character also took on the sense of everyone together—“all,” “entirely.”</p>
