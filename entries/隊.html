    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, <span class="kanji-inline">隊</span> shows the sacred ladder by which the gods ascend and descend (the left element, <span class="kanji-inline">阝</span>), set before a sacrificial animal (<span class="kanji-inline">豕</span>). Together they mark the spot where the deities come down and set foot. From this image of descent, <span class="kanji-inline">隊</span> served as the ancestral graph of <span class="kanji-inline">墜</span> “to fall.” In bronze inscriptions the related graph appears in phrases meaning “not to let fall,” that is, not allowing the achievements of the ancestors to decline. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">隊</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">墜</span> (and a closely related form) belong to one lineage of graphs centered on descent and alighting; later, <span class="kanji-inline">隊</span> came to be used for a “troop” or “group, company.”</p>
