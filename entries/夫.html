    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, <span class="kanji-inline">夫</span> is a pictograph of a man with a hairpin thrust through his topknot. It builds on the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>—the front view of a person with arms and legs outstretched—by adding a short stroke at the crown to mark the ceremonial hairpin, depicting a man in full formal dress. A complementary character, <span class="kanji-inline">妻</span>, shows a woman arranging three hairpins in her coiffure with the help of a hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>), the image of bridal finery. Together, <span class="kanji-inline">夫</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">妻</span> present bridegroom and bride in wedding attire, from which <span class="kanji-inline">夫</span> came to mean “husband,” and by extension “man.” The character also appears in respectful titles such as <span class="kanji-inline">夫</span><span class="kanji-inline">人</span> (“Lady,” an honorific for another’s wife) and <span class="kanji-inline">夫</span><span class="kanji-inline">子</span> (“Master,” for an elder or learned teacher). In classical usage it further serves as a particle: an opening exclamation at the start of speech (“sore”) and a sentence-final note of lament or emphasis (“kana”).</p>
