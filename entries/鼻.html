From this sense of the nose as foremost, the term <span class="kanji-inline">鼻</span><span class="kanji-inline">祖</span> came to mean the first ancestor or originator. Echoing the same imagery, popular belief once held that a child emerges nose-first at birth, and in southern China there was even a custom called <span class="kanji-inline">鼻</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="飲.html">飲</a>, “nose drinking,” of taking in water through the nose.</p>
