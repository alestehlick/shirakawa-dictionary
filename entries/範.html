    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">範</span> is a phono-semantic character. Its phonetic element (han/fan) points to an ancient rite: the purification of military chariots at the army’s departure, in which a dog was run over beneath the yoke to avert impurity. Classical sources such as the Shuowen already gloss <span class="kanji-inline">範</span> as this chariot-purification ceremony. From the associated sense of covering from above, <span class="kanji-inline">範</span> (also written <span class="kanji-inline">笵</span>) came to mean a mold or form—specifically, a mold made of bamboo that is covered from above—complementing <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="模.html">模</a>, a corresponding form made from wood. From this concrete “mold” arose the abstract meanings of pattern, model, and norm, as seen in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="模.html">模</a><span class="kanji-inline">範</span>, and by extension the idea of a rule or law.</p>
