    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Ancient forms of this character are pictographic, showing a roofed structure raised above the ground: an open space below that does not touch the earth, with a chamber above where goods are tightly packed. It depicts a high-floor granary designed to keep cereals dry, and by extension a storehouse or storeroom. From this idea developed related graphs, such as <span class="kanji-inline">鄙</span> (hi), which originally evoked farmland with grain stores and came to mean the rustic or rural district, and <span class="kanji-inline">廩</span> (rin), denoting a granary specifically for storing rice.</p>
