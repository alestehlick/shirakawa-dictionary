    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">儉</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the person element joins the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">僉</span>. <span class="kanji-inline">僉</span> depicts people standing together to offer covenant vessels in which written prayers were placed for the gods, and so it conveys “all, together” along with a sense of reverent restraint. With the person added, <span class="kanji-inline">儉</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">倹</span> evokes someone conducting prayer quietly and without clamor—an image of measured, simple self-restraint that gives the meanings “frugal” and “modest.” The same phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">僉</span> appears in <span class="kanji-inline">検</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">険</span>, and it supplies the shared on reading ken.</p>
