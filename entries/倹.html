    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">儉</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the person element joins the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">僉</span>. <span class="kanji-inline">僉</span> depicts people standing together to offer covenant vessels in which written prayers were placed for the gods, and so it conveys “all, together” along with a sense of reverent restraint. With the person added, <span class="kanji-inline">儉</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">倹</span> evokes someone conducting prayer quietly and without clamor—an image of measured, simple self-restraint that gives the meanings “frugal” and “modest.” The same phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">僉</span> appears in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="検.html">検</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="険.html">険</a>, and it supplies the shared on reading ken.</p>
