    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its original form, <span class="kanji-inline">建</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">聿</span>, a writing brush set upright, with <span class="kanji-inline">廴</span>, the extended enclosure that signifies the walled central court where rites were performed. In that sacred court a brush was erected, directions and the lie of the land were divined, and the site of a city was determined. A marker pillar was raised and the foundation rite of diànji (tenki)—burying offerings to purify and secure the ground—was carried out. After the rites, tools were taken up and the earth was tamped to form the base of construction, the domain later expressed by <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="築.html">築</a>. When such construction was completed, the capital stood and the founding of the state (<span class="kanji-inline">建</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="国.html">国</a>) followed. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">建</span> first evoked surveying, demarcating, and laying out a capital, and by extension came to mean setting up or building in general, even the establishing of laws, calendars, and other institutions.</p>
