    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The earliest form was <span class="kanji-inline">辠</span>, combining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="自.html">自</a>, the outline of the nose/face, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辛.html">辛</a>, a large tattooing needle, to depict the act of tattooing the face—a penal mark—thus giving the sense of crime. The later graph <span class="kanji-inline">罪</span> uses the net radical and originally pictured a bamboo fishing net, yet already in the Book of Odes and the Analects it appears with the meaning crime. When the Qin unified the script under the First Emperor, <span class="kanji-inline">罪</span> was adopted as the standard form, replacing <span class="kanji-inline">辠</span>.</p>
