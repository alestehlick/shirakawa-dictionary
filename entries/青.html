    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">靑</span>, this is a phono-semantic character. In bronze inscriptions the upper element is <span class="kanji-inline">生</span>, which serves as the phonetic that yields the on reading sei and also depicts a sprouting plant, evoking the fresh blue-green of young growth. The lower element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丹.html">丹</a> portrays a pit or well for gathering cinnabar, the mineral earth used as a base for pigments. Ancient sources list many such mineral colors—white cinnabar, blue cinnabar (<span class="kanji-inline">青</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丹.html">丹</a>), vermilion earth (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丹.html">丹</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="雅.html">雅</a>), and blue earth (<span class="kanji-inline">青</span><span class="kanji-inline">曠</span>)—and blue colorants were prepared from this cinnabar-bearing soil. Like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="朱.html">朱</a> (vermilion), which derives from mercuric sulfide, <span class="kanji-inline">青</span> names a mineral color thought not to fade and thus suited to consecratory uses. From these associations the graph came to signify the clear, enduring hues we call blue and green.</p>
