    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the rain radical signals a violent weather phenomenon, while <span class="kanji-inline">辰</span> supplies the sound shin and originally depicted a clam-like creature extending and moving. This <span class="kanji-inline">辰</span> is linked with <span class="kanji-inline">蜃</span>, the giant clam thought to possess spiritual power, lending a numinous force to the idea of a world made to shiver. The Shuowen glosses <span class="kanji-inline">震</span> as the thunderous rumble that sets things quaking. Oracle-bone inscriptions use the character in divinations such as asking whether the land or the army would “tremble” that night—whether an earthquake or unforeseen shock would occur. From the image of thunder reverberating, the meaning broadened from “thunder, thunder rolls” to the shaking and trembling of people and things, and by extension to being startled or shuddering.</p>
