    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">逆</span> is a phono-semantic compound. Its core element is <span class="kanji-inline">屰</span>, an inverted form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>, which originally depicts a person standing with arms and legs outspread; flipped, it suggests someone coming from the opposite side when seen from above. When the walking/road element <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> (⻌) is added, the graph takes on the sense of movement, yielding the idea of going to meet from the opposite direction—proceeding counter to the line of advance. From this image of inversion, the character broadened in use to mark reversal against proper order (as in the contrast of “order and contraversion”) and, in general, acting contrary to reason: to oppose, resist, or disobey. The phonetic value of <span class="kanji-inline">屰</span> supplies the On reading gyaku.</p>
