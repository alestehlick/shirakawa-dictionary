    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> marks the material, wood, and <span class="kanji-inline">奉</span> supplies the sound while recalling its original form—both hands lifting up a branching twig (<span class="kanji-inline">丰</span>), with an additional supporting hand from below. From this image arises the meaning of a thick wooden stick or club. The Shuowen records <span class="kanji-inline">棓</span> as the earlier, proper form for a whip or rod, with <span class="kanji-inline">棒</span> coming into common use from the Wei and Jin periods. The sense is preserved in modern usage such as Chinese <span class="kanji-inline">棒</span><span class="kanji-inline">球</span> (baseball) and the idiom <span class="kanji-inline">針</span><span class="kanji-inline">小</span><span class="kanji-inline">棒</span><span class="kanji-inline">大</span>, to turn something as small as a needle into something as large as a club, i.e., to exaggerate.</p>
