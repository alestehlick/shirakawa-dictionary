    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">燈</span>, this is a phono-semantic character formed with the fire element for meaning and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="登.html">登</a> for sound; the later vulgar form <span class="kanji-inline">灯</span>, now the general-use character, similarly carries the fire element with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丁.html">丁</a> as its phonetic guide. Traditional dictionaries gloss it as a fire light, akin to a candle or lamp, and in Japanese it names both the light itself (tomoshibi) and the flame (hi). By extension it can also refer to lighting implements—candelabra with multiple cup-like pans—evoked by masterpieces such as the celebrated fifteen-bowl bronze lamp excavated from the Warring States–period Zhongshan royal tombs.</p>
