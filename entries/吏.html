    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa understands <span class="kanji-inline">吏</span> as a ritual term. The graph combines <span class="kanji-inline">史</span> with a streamer. In the oracle-bone tradition, <span class="kanji-inline">史</span> depicts a hand raising a branch to which a sai—a covenant receptacle for writings addressed to the gods—is attached, an image of venerating ancestral spirits. Related graphs unfold this scene: <span class="kanji-inline">使</span> fixes the sai to a great tree and goes out to worship mountains and rivers; <span class="kanji-inline">事</span> adds a streamer to that branch to mark a state ceremony at such sacred sites. <span class="kanji-inline">吏</span> designates the person who conducts these religious services. In oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, the forms of <span class="kanji-inline">事</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">吏</span> are essentially the same; only later did <span class="kanji-inline">吏</span> come to mean an office-holder—an official who governs and manages.</p>
