    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the left element <span class="kanji-inline">巾</span> depicts cloth, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="凡.html">凡</a> serves as the sound element. Shirakawa notes that <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="凡.html">凡</a> is an old form related to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="盤.html">盤</a> and already functioned as a phonetic indicator in the oracle-bone form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="風.html">風</a>. Here, the cloth component shows a sheet catching the wind to drive a boat, giving the concrete sense of a sail and, by extension, sailing craft such as the hokake-bune. As river and coastal navigation expanded—especially in Jiangnan from the Three Kingdoms era onward—large sailing vessels were built, and even letter-writing reflected this world, with greetings like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="布.html">布</a><span class="kanji-inline">帆</span><span class="kanji-inline">恙</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="無.html">無</a>し, “the cloth sail is without mishap,” wishing safe passage. In the same phonetic series, <span class="kanji-inline">汎</span> carries senses such as “to float” and “broad,” resonating with the imagery of water and wind gathered in <span class="kanji-inline">帆</span>.</p>
