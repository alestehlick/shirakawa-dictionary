    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: <span class="kanji-inline">足</span> provides the sense of legs and movement, while <span class="kanji-inline">翟</span>, which depicts a bird lifting its wings to take flight, supplies the sound. The same phonetic appears in <span class="kanji-inline">曜</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">耀</span>. In early usage, <span class="kanji-inline">躍</span> evokes an animal raising its legs to spring upward, which gives the core meanings “to leap, jump,” and by extension “swift” and “to rise,” as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">跳</span><span class="kanji-inline">躍</span>.</p>
