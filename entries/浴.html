    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">浴</span> is a phono-semantic character: the water element provides the sense of washing, while the phonetic is the special <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="谷.html">谷</a> used as an On-reading marker in this series—not the “valley” koku, but the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="谷.html">谷</a> seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="俗.html">俗</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="容.html">容</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="欲.html">欲</a>. Shirakawa describes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="容.html">容</a> as the act of presenting a ritual covenant vessel (sai) that holds written petitions in an ancestral mausoleum, with the divine pneuma faintly manifesting above; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="欲.html">欲</a> expresses the desire to behold that epiphany. In this ritual setting, <span class="kanji-inline">浴</span> denotes the ablutions performed in preparation for mausoleum prayer, and by extension it came to mean bathing and pouring water over oneself. In ancient practice, water was also poured over prisoners of war and the dead for purification and exorcism, even as a rite of revival. Relatedly, <span class="kanji-inline">沐</span> refers to washing the hair, and <span class="kanji-inline">沐</span><span class="kanji-inline">浴</span> to the full lustration of hair and body.</p>
