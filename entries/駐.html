    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with <span class="kanji-inline">馬</span> “horse” indicating the semantic field of movement and halting, and <span class="kanji-inline">主</span> as the phonetic. <span class="kanji-inline">主</span> serves as the on-reading indicator seen also in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="柱.html">柱</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="注.html">注</a>; in its older form it depicts a candlestick with a flame on a tallow tray, and by extension, like a pillar, suggests something set firmly in place. The Shuowen glosses it as “a horse halting.” From the image of a horse standing still, the meaning broadened to staying or stopping in general, hence the senses of halting and being stationed.</p>
