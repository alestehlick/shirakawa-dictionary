    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="馬.html">馬</a> “horse” indicating the semantic field of movement and halting, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="主.html">主</a> as the phonetic. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="主.html">主</a> serves as the on-reading indicator seen also in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="柱.html">柱</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="注.html">注</a>; in its older form it depicts a candlestick with a flame on a tallow tray, and by extension, like a pillar, suggests something set firmly in place. The Shuowen glosses it as “a horse halting.” From the image of a horse standing still, the meaning broadened to staying or stopping in general, hence the senses of halting and being stationed.</p>
