    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">聽</span>, this character is a compound built on the ear sign <span class="kanji-inline">耳</span>, the graph <span class="kanji-inline">壬</span> depicting a person seen from the side standing on tiptoe in prayer, and a component of <span class="kanji-inline">德</span>, evoking virtuous, keen receptivity. In oracle-bone and bronze forms, an ear is paired with a covenant vessel into which petitions to the gods were placed, picturing sung prayers and the capacity to receive the deities’ voices and revelations. <span class="kanji-inline">聴</span> thus names the sagacious faculty of hearing the divine voice and, by extension, means to listen and heed. From the notion of receptive hearing comes the sense of accepting another’s words or plea, hence permitting or granting, as in <span class="kanji-inline">聴</span><span class="kanji-inline">許</span> “approval.” Related graphs illuminate the same ritual scene: <span class="kanji-inline">聖</span> portrays the worshiper who hears the gods, and <span class="kanji-inline">聡</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">聰</span>) expresses the keen understanding of that voice.</p>
