    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the tree radical <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> supplies the meaning, while the phonetic element san (<span class="kanji-inline">彡</span>) gives the on reading. The phonetic base san is scarcely attested as an independent graph, and this tree name itself is rare in the oldest texts; yet it appears in later literature, as in Du Fu’s “Singing Thoughts on Ruins,” which speaks of cedars and pines at a mausoleum where storks nest—a scene that reflects how cedars commonly stood around tombs and monastic precincts.</p>
