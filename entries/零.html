    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">零</span> is a phono-semantic character: the rain radical supplies the idea of rainfall, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="令.html">令</a> serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading rei. Early lexica gloss it as “remaining rain” or “quiet rain,” evoking rain that falls softly. From this image of scattered droplets came uses for “to fall,” as when blossoms and leaves drop like raindrops, and by extension a sense of decline or shabbiness. The nuance of tiny scattered bits underlies compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">零</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="細.html">細</a>, meaning extremely small or trifling. In later usage, this sense of negation or scattered nothingness was applied to the numeral zero, as in <span class="kanji-inline">零</span><span class="kanji-inline">下</span> for temperatures below zero.</p>
