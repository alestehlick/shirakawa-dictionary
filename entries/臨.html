    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">臨</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">臥</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="品.html">品</a>. <span class="kanji-inline">臥</span> depicts a person with eyes cast downward, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="品.html">品</a> shows three ritual sai—vessels in which written prayers to the gods are placed—set in a row. The graph as a whole portrays the divine spirit in heaven bending to look down in answer to those offerings, an act of overseeing from above. From this sacred scene the word broadened to mean being present at a situation, facing it directly, and by extension supervising or looking down over it. The Book of Odes preserves this sense in the line <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="神.html">神</a><span class="kanji-inline">臨</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="女.html">女</a>, “The deity was with you,” evoking the god’s attending presence.</p>
