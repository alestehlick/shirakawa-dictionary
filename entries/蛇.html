    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa understands <span class="kanji-inline">蛇</span> as a phono-semantic character: the left side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="虫.html">虫</a> supplies the semantic field of reptiles and creeping creatures, while the right side <span class="kanji-inline">它</span> serves as the phonetic. In the oldest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">它</span> itself depicted a snake with an enlarged head and originally carried the meaning of “snake,” but as <span class="kanji-inline">它</span> later came to be used for the sense of “other,” a new graph was formed by adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="虫.html">虫</a> to preserve the snake meaning as <span class="kanji-inline">蛇</span>. In oracle-bone inscriptions the sign used as the phonetic marker in <span class="kanji-inline">祀</span> already takes the shape of a snake (the form later written <span class="kanji-inline">巳</span>), reflecting how snakes figured centrally in early nature worship. Because they dwell in ravines and low, marshy places, snakes were venerated as valley deities, known in Japan as yatonokami, and revered as numinous beings.</p>
