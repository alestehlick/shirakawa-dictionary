    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with the tree element <span class="kanji-inline">木</span> and the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="票.html">票</a> (hyo). In archaic form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="票.html">票</a> depicts a body held aloft and burning, made conspicuous by the force of the flames; the Shuowen also glosses it as the tip of a treetop. In <span class="kanji-inline">標</span>, this idea of what stands out is applied to wood set upright so it can be seen—a treetop, pole, or post—hence the notion of an erected marker. From setting up a pillar as a signpost to using it to indicate or label, the character came to mean a mark or sign and, by extension, the act of putting one up.</p>
