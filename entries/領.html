    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">領</span> as a phono‑semantic compound: the head radical <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span> provides the idea of the head/neck, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="令.html">令</a> supplies the sound. Early lexica explain it as the nape or back of the neck, a sense vividly echoed in a verse of the Book of Odes that praises a woman’s graceful neck. From this literal “neck” meaning—paired with the “waist” <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="腰.html">腰</a> as vital bodily points—arises the notion of the essentials or the gist, as in the word <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="要.html">要</a><span class="kanji-inline">領</span>. By extension the character came to mean leading or managing people and, consequently, the realm under one’s control, hence senses such as jurisdiction and territory; in concrete usage it also denotes the collar at the neck.</p>
