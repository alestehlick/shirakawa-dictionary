    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the oracle-bone and bronze forms, <span class="kanji-inline">疾</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a>, the front view of a person standing with arms and legs spread, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="矢.html">矢</a>, an arrow, to picture someone struck under the arm—an arrow wound. In later script the human figure <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a> was reshaped into the sickness radical <span class="kanji-inline">疒</span>, the image of a person lying on a bed (<span class="kanji-inline">牀</span>), and the character came to mean illness in general. Early usage even glossed “<span class="kanji-inline">疾</span> is <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="病.html">病</a>,” with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="病.html">病</a> referring in particular to severe disease. From the core idea of affliction the word broadened: it came to express hostile or envious feeling, as in <span class="kanji-inline">疾</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="視.html">視</a> and in jealousy terms, and also the sense of swiftness, as in <span class="kanji-inline">疾</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="風.html">風</a> and compounds describing speed.</p>
