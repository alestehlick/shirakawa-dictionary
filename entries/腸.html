    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the “flesh” element indicates the body, while its phonetic partner is the same element found in <span class="kanji-inline">暢</span> (cho, “to grow, lengthen”), which provides the on reading and evokes the long, extended coils of the gut. The Shuowen defines it explicitly as the large and small intestines, showing that even antiquity distinguished the small intestine. The graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="脹.html">脹</a> was also used with the sense “intestines,” but appears to be a later creation. Strong emotions were felt as pain in the belly, giving rise to the expression <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="断.html">断</a><span class="kanji-inline">腸</span>の<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="思.html">思</a>い, a grief so piercing it is as if one’s bowels were cut. Shishuo Xinyu tells of a mother monkey in Shu who died after pursuing, across the Three Gorges, the soldier who seized her child; when her belly was opened her intestines were found torn, and the Jin general Huan Wen, enraged, dismissed the soldier—an episode often cited to illustrate the poignancy of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="断.html">断</a><span class="kanji-inline">腸</span>.</p>
