    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the semantic element is the “going” radical (<span class="kanji-inline">辵</span>), evoking movement and passage, while the phonetic is <span class="kanji-inline">秀</span> (shū), which signals the on-reading tō. Early lexica such as the Guangya and the Yupian note what seems to be an older sense now scarcely attested, but from the Six Dynasties onward the usage clearly settles on “to pass through; to be transparent.” Meng Xi’s Brush Talks famously mentions the “light-penetrating mirror” (copper mirrors that, at certain angles, make light seem to pass through), an image that vividly embodies the word’s core idea. In Japanese this meaning remains active in readings like suku, sukeru, sukasu, and tooru, heard in expressions such as a fence “showing through” or looking “through” glass.</p>
