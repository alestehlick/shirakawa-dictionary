    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">式</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">弋</span>, the corded bird‑snaring arrow that also functioned as a ritual implement, with a sacred tool held in the left hand by a shaman to guard the holy and drive out impurity. Together they portray the act of expelling malign forces and restoring proper order. From this image the character comes to mean a model or rule—what one conforms to and takes as the standard. Related graphs preserve this exorcistic core: <span class="kanji-inline">拭</span> describes wiping away defilement with these implements; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="試.html">試</a> depicts purification by spoken incantation in prayer; and <span class="kanji-inline">弑</span> shows dispelling an animal’s curse‑spirit until it perishes.</p>
