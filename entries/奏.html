    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The graph combines <span class="kanji-inline">丰</span>, a sprig raised upward in rites to invite a deity, with a reduced form of <span class="kanji-inline">矣</span>, the act of presenting. Together they depict presenting something before the gods—originally, the performance of music as a sacred offering. The Book of Rites (Jade-Bead Pendants) records “<span class="kanji-inline">奏</span><span class="kanji-inline">而</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="食.html">食</a>,” indicating that music was played at meals, and ritual protocol called for music before and after worship. The so-called “metal performance,” the sounding of bells, regulated rhythm and signaled the gods’ arrival and departure. From this core sense of playing music in offering, the meaning broadened to making formal statements or reports before the gods or the sovereign.</p>
