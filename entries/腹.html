    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">腹</span> as a phono-semantic compound. The right-hand element (fuku) serves as the phonetic and originally depicts an inverted measuring vessel with a swollen, rounded belly, evoking a sense of fullness. Joined with the meat radical <span class="kanji-inline">月</span>, which marks a part of the body, the character designates the body’s fullest, fleshiest part—the hara, the belly. Early glosses already call it “thick,” referring to the thick flesh of the abdomen, and by extension the graph also came to signify the inner seat of feeling, the mind.</p>
