    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">称</span> as a phono-semantic character whose original form is <span class="kanji-inline">稱</span>: the grain radical <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span> supplies the field of meaning, while the phonetic element depicts a hand (<span class="kanji-inline">爪</span>) lifting a scale weight (<span class="kanji-inline">冉</span>). The image is of putting grain on a balance; hence the core sense is to measure or weigh. When the measure comes up to the counterweight—when it matches—it yields the idea of attaining or meeting a standard. Because weighing is done by lifting the pan, the character also developed the senses to raise and, by extension, to extol or praise. The phonetic part supplies the on-reading shō.</p>
