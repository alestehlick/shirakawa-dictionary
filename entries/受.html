    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, <span class="kanji-inline">受</span> brings together two hands—an upper hand written with<span class="kanji-inline">爪</span> and a lower hand with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>—around <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舟.html">舟</a>, which here represents a tray or bowl. The upper hand places something into the vessel, while the lower hand takes it out, so the graph captures both sides of the exchange. Accordingly, in oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions it could mean either to grant or to receive. Later, the act of granting was distinguished with the creation of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="授.html">授</a>, and <span class="kanji-inline">受</span> settled into its familiar sense of receiving.</p>
