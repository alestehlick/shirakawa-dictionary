    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">假</span>, this is a phono-semantic graph: the person radical indicates a human context, while <span class="kanji-inline">艮</span> serves as the phonetic element for ka. Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">艮</span> as depicting the quarrying of a rough stone and its careful polishing into beautiful jade. In this light, <span class="kanji-inline">假</span> evokes the crafted completion of a human face—hence <span class="kanji-inline">仮</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="面.html">面</a>, a mask, a made face placed over one’s own. From the idea of a fabricated stand-in for the real, the character comes to mean something that imitates the original and temporarily takes its place, giving rise to senses such as provisional and temporary, as in <span class="kanji-inline">仮</span>に.</p>
