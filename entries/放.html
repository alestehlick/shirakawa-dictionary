    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">放</span> as a compound of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="方.html">方</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>. In ancient form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="方.html">方</a> depicts a corpse hung from a transverse beam, erected at the border as an apotropaic charm, while <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span> means to strike. The graph thus shows the ritual striking of the suspended body to banish malign spirits. From this exorcistic act flow the senses of sending forth or emitting, driving away or thrusting aside, and by extension letting go, releasing, or separating—hence its later use in compounds for unrestrained, self-indulgent behavior. Related characters illuminate the same scene: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="白.html">白</a> is the bleached skull; <span class="kanji-inline">敫</span> depicts beating the remaining skull; <span class="kanji-inline">敖</span> expresses rousing the spirit’s power to demand the expulsion of evil; <span class="kanji-inline">徼</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">邀</span> place the rite at the border or on the road, and <span class="kanji-inline">嗷</span> is the cry raised during it; adding <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="白.html">白</a> highlights the whiteness of the skull; and <span class="kanji-inline">檄</span> names a proclamation intended to stir people by the force of its writing. All trace back to the image of striking the suspended corpse to summon power and send it out against evil.</p>
