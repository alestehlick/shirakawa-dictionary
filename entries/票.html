    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">票</span> is a compound graph. In very early writing it appears in a form like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="興.html">興</a>, combining <span class="kanji-inline">囟</span> (a human head), <span class="kanji-inline">臼</span> (two hands joined), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="火.html">火</a> (fire): it depicts holding the head of a corpse with both hands and burning it, the body standing out in the vigor of the flames. From this image arose senses of rising lightly, leaping, quivering, and quickness. As a phonetic it carries that nuance of speed and lightness in characters such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="標.html">標</a>, <span class="kanji-inline">嫖</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">慓</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">飄</span>; in particular, <span class="kanji-inline">嫖</span>, with additional fire, evokes the intensified force of the blaze. In later usage <span class="kanji-inline">票</span> shifted to mean a slip of paper or card, hence “ticket,” “receipt,” and “ballot,” as seen in words like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="伝.html">伝</a><span class="kanji-inline">票</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="投.html">投</a><span class="kanji-inline">票</span>.</p>
