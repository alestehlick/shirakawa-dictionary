    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A picto-phonetic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="化.html">化</a> supplies the on reading ka and, as a graph that originally shows two bodies laid out, carries the sense of change—hence exchange—while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a> depicts the cowry shell used as early currency. In antiquity, such South Sea cowries were prized as “shell money” (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a><span class="kanji-inline">貨</span>) and revered for their life-producing power. As media of exchange later broadened to bronze tools and textiles, the graph appears in terms like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a><span class="kanji-inline">貨</span> (“knife money”) and <span class="kanji-inline">貨</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幣.html">幣</a> (“coinage,” with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="幣.html">幣</a> meaning silk). Rooted in this history, <span class="kanji-inline">貨</span> came to denote money and valuables, and by extension goods, wares, and treasure.</p>
