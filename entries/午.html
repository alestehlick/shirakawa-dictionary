    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">午</span> as a pictograph of a wooden mallet (kine) used in apotropaic cursing rites to ward off harm. This ritual sense ties it to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="御.html">御</a>/<span class="kanji-inline">禦</span>, the act of warding or controlling: the oldest graphs for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="御.html">御</a> look like a bundled mass of threads, but later forms converge toward the shape seen in <span class="kanji-inline">午</span>; when the mallet is shown explicitly as a curse implement it appears as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="卸.html">卸</a>, which he takes to be the original writing of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="御.html">御</a>. From this ritual object the character was later borrowed as the name of one of the Twelve Earthly Branches; in calendrical use it came to denote the noon hour, and in the zodiac it was paired with the horse. The graph is also used with the sense “to go against.”</p>
