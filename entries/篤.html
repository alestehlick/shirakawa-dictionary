    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">篤</span> is a compound of the bamboo sign and a horse. Here the bamboo element is an abbreviated form of <span class="kanji-inline">竺</span>, which classical glosses equate with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="厚.html">厚</a>, “thick, cordial,” and which also carried the sense of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="毒.html">毒</a>, “poison.” When this idea is applied to a horse (<span class="kanji-inline">馬</span>), the character first evoked a horse stricken by poison, suggesting a condition of gravity and seriousness. From that core arose the positive sense of deep warmth and sincerity, seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">篤</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="学.html">学</a> (earnest study), <span class="kanji-inline">篤</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="行.html">行</a> (sincere conduct), and <span class="kanji-inline">篤</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="実.html">実</a> (true-heartedness). In later usage the notion of seriousness developed specifically in the medical sphere, yielding terms such as <span class="kanji-inline">篤</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="疾.html">疾</a> (severe illness) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="危.html">危</a><span class="kanji-inline">篤</span> (critical condition).</p>
