    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character whose original form is written <span class="kanji-inline">襃</span>: the outer element is <span class="kanji-inline">衣</span>, “garment,” and within it sits <span class="kanji-inline">孚</span> as the phonetic. <span class="kanji-inline">孚</span> depicts a hand placed over a child, an image Shirakawa reads as the full, nurturing breast while holding a child to nurse. From this image of ample embrace arise senses of “wide” and “loose” as of flowing clothing, and by extension the gracious act of praising and rewarding. Hence its use in words for official commendations and prizes, such as <span class="kanji-inline">褒</span><span class="kanji-inline">賞</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">褒</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="美.html">美</a>, and <span class="kanji-inline">褒</span><span class="kanji-inline">章</span>.</p>
