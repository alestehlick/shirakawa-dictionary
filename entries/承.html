    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines setsu (<span class="kanji-inline">卩</span>), the figure of a kneeling person, with kyō (<span class="kanji-inline">廾</span>), a pair of hands placed side by side. In the ancient form it portrays a person bending or kneeling and raising something with both hands—a gesture of supporting and offering from below. Early lexica gloss it as both offering and receiving. From this image arose the sense of humbly accepting what is bestowed from above—receiving a command or teaching and carrying it out with deference—and, by extension, taking over what has been passed on, hence the meanings of succession and inheritance.</p>
