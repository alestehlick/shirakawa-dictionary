    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines the divination sign <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>, which in early oracle-bone and bronze forms depicts not a shell but a sacrificial tripod (ding). <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span> shows the crack made by heating a tortoise plastron, the medium for consulting the divine will. <span class="kanji-inline">貞</span> thus portrays divination performed with the tripod, a ritual of asking and determining the gods’ intent by observing the state of the sacrificial offering. The result of such divination (<span class="kanji-inline">貞</span><span class="kanji-inline">卜</span>) was regarded as correct, good, and true, which gave the character its senses of uprightness, chastity, and integrity. The Zuozhuan (Ai, 17th year) records “<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衛.html">衛</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="侯.html">侯</a><span class="kanji-inline">貞</span><span class="kanji-inline">卜</span>,” attesting to this practice.</p>
