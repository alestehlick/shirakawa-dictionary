    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">幣</span> is a phono-semantic graph built on the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">敝</span> (hei). <span class="kanji-inline">敝</span> itself combines the image of a ceremonial apron with the action sign <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span> “to strike,” suggesting a garment worn and frayed through ritual use. Classical glosses already define <span class="kanji-inline">幣</span> as <span class="kanji-inline">帛</span>, “silk,” and by extension refer to <span class="kanji-inline">幣</span><span class="kanji-inline">帛</span>—the silk offerings presented to the gods. In ancient rites, valuable goods such as silk, jade, horses, and leather were given as nusa, offerings offered in prayer. From this ritual sense of a formal gift, the character’s meaning later broadened to encompass “currency” and “money.”</p>
