    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with the clothing radical and <span class="kanji-inline">甫</span> as the phonetic, <span class="kanji-inline">補</span> takes its sound from <span class="kanji-inline">甫</span> (ho). Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">甫</span> as the figure of a young plant showing its roots, carrying the idea of enclosing or wrapping. Set beside the clothing element, the character originally pictured wrapping a frayed spot of cloth to mend it—hence the sense seen in hoshuu, “mending,” and the broader meanings “to supplement,” “to repair,” and “to make up for,” extending naturally to “to help.” In the same phonetic series, <span class="kanji-inline">輔</span> (ho) names the braces fixed alongside a vehicle’s frame—the splints that assist the wheel—further illustrating the shared notion of supporting and aiding.</p>
