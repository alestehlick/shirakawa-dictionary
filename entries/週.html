    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">週</span> is a phono-semantic compound: the walking/path element <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> supplies the idea of movement, while the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="周.html">周</a> gives the sound. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="周.html">周</a> itself depicts the face of a square shield divided by a cross into quarters with ornamented panels—an emblem associated with the Zhou clan. In warfare, a covenant vessel was set beneath such a shield and prayers for victory were recited, underscoring <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="周.html">周</a>’s ritual aura. With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="周.html">周</a> providing the sound shuu and <span class="kanji-inline">辵</span> the meaning “to go,” <span class="kanji-inline">週</span> came to mean making a circuit or going around, and by extension the regular return of days in a fixed cycle—hence the “week,” set as a cycle of seven days.</p>
