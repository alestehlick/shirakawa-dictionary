    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">后</span> as a compound graph combining the person element with an enclosing frame to show a ritual covenant casket set before a person. In structure and intent it parallels <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="君.html">君</a>, and in early usage it designated the ruler’s consort—the queen or empress. In oracle-bone inscriptions, however, the graph appears as the figure of a woman giving birth, a form akin to <span class="kanji-inline">毓</span> “to bring up, to nurture.” In such texts, expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">后</span>(<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="後.html">後</a>)<span class="kanji-inline">祖</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丁.html">丁</a> are written as <span class="kanji-inline">毓</span><span class="kanji-inline">祖</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="丁.html">丁</a>, indicating that <span class="kanji-inline">后</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">毓</span> functioned as the same sign there, and that <span class="kanji-inline">后</span> also served to write the sense later standardized as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="後.html">後</a>, “after.”</p>
