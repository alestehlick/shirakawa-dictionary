    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">寺</span> is a phono‑semantic character. In early forms the upper element <span class="kanji-inline">之</span>—originally a footprint—serves as the phonetic that signals the on reading, while the lower <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a> depicts a hand at the fingertips, the act of putting the hand to something. Together they convey the idea of holding, and <span class="kanji-inline">寺</span> first functioned as the original graph for <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="持.html">持</a> “to hold.” In the court sphere it then came to designate an attendant at the palace, especially a eunuch, and by extension a government office, a sense reflected in later usage. The bureau called Honglusi, which received foreign envoys, was eventually turned into lodgings for monks; from that institutional shift, <span class="kanji-inline">寺</span> naturally settled into its familiar meaning of a Buddhist temple.</p>
