    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph that sets the roof sign <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span> over a dog, depicting the animal placed beneath the eaves as a foundation offering. In oracle-bone and bronze forms the dog is drawn with its tail hanging down, marking it as a sacrificial victim interred at the start of construction in a rite of soil pacification to appease the earth deities. The character thus first named an ancestral mausoleum—a sacred building for honoring forebears. As people lived in relation to this center, its sense broadened to the dwelling itself and, by extension, to the family or clan and their way of life.</p>
