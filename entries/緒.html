    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">緒</span> is a phono-semantic character combining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a>, the thread radical, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a> as its phonetic. In early forms, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="者.html">者</a> depicts the act of burying an etsu— a covenant vessel containing petitions to the gods—within an earthen village wall as a protective barrier against harm. Joined to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="糸.html">糸</a>, this yields the image of thread ends bound together, the starting point one can grasp. From this concrete sense it came to mean the beginning of things and a clue that lets one take hold of a matter, and also the remainder or what is left over. By extension it refers to the stirrings of the mind and heart, as in compounds like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a><span class="kanji-inline">緒</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="情.html">情</a><span class="kanji-inline">緒</span>. In Japanese it is read o in words such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鼻.html">鼻</a><span class="kanji-inline">緒</span>, the thong of a geta sandal.</p>
