    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">讀</span>, this is a phono-semantic character formed with the speech element and <span class="kanji-inline">賣</span> as its phonetic, which supplies the On readings (as also seen in <span class="kanji-inline">瀆</span> “toku/doku” and <span class="kanji-inline">牘</span> “toku”). Early citations describe praising poems and reading writings, and the Guliang Commentary to the Spring and Autumn Annals records the act of reading a text and placing it upon a sacrifice—evidence that the word referred to reading ritual prayers aloud to the gods. It is closely linked to <span class="kanji-inline">籀</span> (zhou/chū), which in bronze inscriptions denotes the formal reading of appointment texts. From this ceremonial, public recitation, the sense later broadened to the general meaning “to read.”</p>
