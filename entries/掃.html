    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character written with the hand element on the left and <span class="kanji-inline">帚</span> on the right. <span class="kanji-inline">帚</span>, which carries the on reading sou, depicts a broom—twigs or leaves bound to the end of a stick—used to sprinkle fragrant liquid in ancestral mausoleums for purification and exorcism. Thus <span class="kanji-inline">掃</span> originally means to hold a broom in the hand and perform ritual cleansing within the mausoleum, and by extension it comes to mean sweeping away defilement. The Shuowen records the older form <span class="kanji-inline">埽</span>, but the common form is <span class="kanji-inline">掃</span>. In ritual language it pairs with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="除.html">除</a>—originally the act of planting a large needle (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a>) in the ground before the divine ladder (<span class="kanji-inline">梯</span>) used by the gods to ward off malign spirits—to form <span class="kanji-inline">掃</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="除.html">除</a>, a term for purification, which later yielded the everyday sense of sweeping and cleaning.</p>
