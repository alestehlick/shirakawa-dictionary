    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">悩</span> is a phono-semantic character. In its original form <span class="kanji-inline">惱</span>, the heart radical (<span class="kanji-inline">心</span>, here as <span class="kanji-inline">忄</span>) signals the realm of feelings, while the right-hand element serves as the phonetic and corresponds to the ancient graph <span class="kanji-inline">囟</span>, the infant’s fontanel—regarded as the seat of thought. This is the same image seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="思.html">思</a>, whose earliest form places <span class="kanji-inline">囟</span> above <span class="kanji-inline">心</span> and means “to think.” With the heart added, the picture becomes thought in turmoil—brooding and pained reflection—hence the senses “to be troubled” and “to suffer.” The Shuowen gloss “to hold a grudge” further evokes harbored vexation; in usage it expresses nayamu, to be afflicted with worries.</p>
