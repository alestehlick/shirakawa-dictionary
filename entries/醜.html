    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In early forms, the element <span class="kanji-inline">酉</span> points both to the sound and to ritual wine, and Shang-period emblems even depict a figure ladling fragrant wine from a jar, the hair tied up in three distinct tufts, adopting a special ceremonial posture. This scene represents a rite called <span class="kanji-inline">醜</span>, performed with sacrificial wine. Oracle-bone inscriptions record divinations such as “have <span class="kanji-inline">醜</span>?”—consultations on whether to carry out this ceremony to dispel a village curse—showing that the term and graph were already established in the ritual sphere. From the striking, out-of-the-ordinary appearance of the officiant in this rite, the character developed the sense “ugly, unsightly,” and by extension came to mean “bad” and “shameful.”</p>
