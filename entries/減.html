    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">減</span> combines the water element with <span class="kanji-inline">咸</span>, here functioning as the phonetic base (kan) and carrying a ritual image. In Shirakawa’s view, <span class="kanji-inline">咸</span> depicts a sacred receptacle for covenant or prayer slips, sealed by placing the consecrated broadaxe <span class="kanji-inline">戊</span> upon it—an act that &#x27;shuts in&#x27; and preserves the efficacy of the prayer. When the water element is added, it signifies watering down or sullying what is holy, thus diminishing its force. He evokes the same logic in <span class="kanji-inline">盜</span>, where letting liquid drip into the blood of a sworn covenant profanes and breaks that bond. From this notion of diluting sacred potency, <span class="kanji-inline">減</span> came to mean to lessen, decrease, and cut down.</p>
