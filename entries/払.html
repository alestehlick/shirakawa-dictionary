    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">拂</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the hand element (<span class="kanji-inline">扌</span>) is joined with <span class="kanji-inline">弗</span> as the phonetic. Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">弗</span> as the image of a rope wound lengthwise around several pieces of wood—wood that refuses to bundle, spreading and resisting constraint—hence nuances of scattering and opposing. With the hand added, the character comes to depict the act of sweeping aside what will not stay together: brushing off, beating away, removing. From this core image arise compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">払</span><span class="kanji-inline">暁</span>, the “sweeping away” of night at dawn; <span class="kanji-inline">払</span><span class="kanji-inline">拭</span>, a thorough wiping clean; and <span class="kanji-inline">払</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="底.html">底</a>, the complete using-up of supplies. It can also substitute in compounds for <span class="kanji-inline">弼</span> “to aid,” as in <span class="kanji-inline">払</span><span class="kanji-inline">輔</span>. In Japanese, harau extends from the physical motion of brushing off to the social act of payment, as in paying money or attention.</p>
