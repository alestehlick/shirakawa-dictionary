    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">袋</span> is a phono-semantic character: the clothing element indicates a textile object, while the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="代.html">代</a> supplies the on-reading (tai/dai). Classical glosses already link this sound to the idea of a bag—Shuowen Xinfu notes “tai” as a bag, and Shuowen cites <span class="kanji-inline">縢</span> (to bind) in the same sense. Words such as <span class="kanji-inline">帶</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="勝.html">勝</a> were once connected with this same root notion of a tied cloth container. Closely related is <span class="kanji-inline">囊</span>, which in its ancient form was written like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="東.html">東</a>, depicting a cloth sack gathered and bound at both top and bottom. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">袋</span> itself came into regular use from the Sui–Tang period onward and straightforwardly means a bag; in Japan it appears in everyday items such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="足.html">足</a><span class="kanji-inline">袋</span>, the cloth “tabi” socks shaped like little bags for the feet.</p>
