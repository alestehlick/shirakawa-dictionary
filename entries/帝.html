    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a pictograph of a grand ritual altar—a sturdy, elevated stand on which food and wine were set out as offerings to the gods. Whereas <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a> shows an ordinary altar, here the cross-legs are firmly braced to signify the great altar reserved for the highest powers of heaven. Originally, <span class="kanji-inline">帝</span> named the deity worshiped at that great altar: the amatsukami, a nature god, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="上.html">上</a><span class="kanji-inline">帝</span>—the Supreme Deity—at the pinnacle. Bronze inscriptions depict ancestral spirits dwelling in heaven, attending at the left and right of this Supreme Deity. The state sacrifice in honor of <span class="kanji-inline">帝</span> was called <span class="kanji-inline">禘</span>. From the same ritual sphere arise related graphs, such as <span class="kanji-inline">啻</span> (the proto-form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="嫡.html">嫡</a>), created by adding a covenant vessel in which recited prayers were placed; <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="商.html">商</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="嫡.html">嫡</a> thus point to those socially entitled to conduct worship of the heavenly god. In later usage, <span class="kanji-inline">帝</span> came to designate the emperor, the Son of Heaven.</p>
