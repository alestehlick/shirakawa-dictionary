    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">孝</span> as a compound: the upper element abbreviates <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="老.html">老</a>, portraying an elder’s long hair in profile, and the lower <span class="kanji-inline">子</span> is “child.” Together they form the image of a child respectfully serving an older person, and so the character comes to mean loving devotion to one’s parents and exemplary service to them. In Zhou-dynasty bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">孝</span> commonly denotes diligent service and worship toward the ancestors. From Confucius onward, Confucian thought placed <span class="kanji-inline">孝</span> at the heart of ritual propriety and civilized order, a central ideal later articulated in the Classic of Filial Piety, framed as dialogues between Confucius and his disciple Zengzi.</p>
