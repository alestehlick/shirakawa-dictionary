    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa interprets <span class="kanji-inline">修</span> as a compound of <span class="kanji-inline">攸</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">彡</span>. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">攸</span> depicts water being poured over a person’s back, evoking ritual ablution—an act that purifies the body and calms the heart. The addition of <span class="kanji-inline">彡</span> functions as a sign marking what has been refined and made clean. From this image of purification and refinement, <span class="kanji-inline">修</span> comes to mean purifying and putting oneself in order, correcting and regulating one’s conduct, and by extension studying to master skills and repairing or making things right.</p>
