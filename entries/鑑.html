    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">鑑</span> is a phono-semantic character built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="監.html">監</a>. The older graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="監.html">監</a> shows eyes cast down toward a water-filled basin that reflects one’s image—a water mirror—hence the senses “mirror” and “to look.” When mirrors came to be made of bronze, copper, and iron, the metal element <span class="kanji-inline">金</span> was added, yielding <span class="kanji-inline">鑑</span> to indicate a crafted mirror and, by extension, the act of examining or appraising by reflection. Its on reading kan aligns with a sound group that includes characters like <span class="kanji-inline">鏡</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">景</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">煌</span>, all associated with brightness and shining—fitting echoes of a reflective surface.</p>
