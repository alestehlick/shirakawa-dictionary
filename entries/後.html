    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character combines three elements: <span class="kanji-inline">彳</span>, the side of a crossroads, evoking a road; <span class="kanji-inline">幺</span>, a twisted thread bundle used as a ritual curse implement (as seen in the old form of <span class="kanji-inline">禦</span>); and <span class="kanji-inline">夊</span>, footprints turned backward. Together they depict a rite in which a thread-bundle charm is employed to compel an enemy to retreat. From this image of driving someone back arise the senses of “back/behind,” “to move back,” and, by extension, “later/after” and “to be late.”</p>
