    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of the moon, portrayed not as a full disc like the sun <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>, but as the waxing three-day crescent chosen to set it apart. Because the moon waxes and wanes, the slender early crescent captured its characteristic change. The old shape also lies behind <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> “evening,” which originally resembled the moon appearing at dusk. In oracle-bone forms the drawing varies by period, yet consistently shows the three-day crescent. In bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">月</span> bears a dot while <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> does not; in the modern script, <span class="kanji-inline">月</span> carries two small interior strokes, distinguishing it from <span class="kanji-inline">夕</span> with only one. From this image the character came to mean both the visible moon and, by extension, the month.</p>
