    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph built with the clothing radical and the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">曷</span>, which supplies the on reading katsu. In early usage it named a coarse, rough hemp textile whose natural tone was a dark brown, and from this the sense “brown” arose. The cloth appears in words such as kappaku, a padded kimono-like jacket made from it; kappu, a man of the lower class marked by wearing such a jacket; and katsui, rough hempen clothes. In the set phrase kyukatsu—fur for winter (<span class="kanji-inline">裘</span>) and hemp for summer (<span class="kanji-inline">褐</span>)—it can also stand for the full cycle of a year.</p>
