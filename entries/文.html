    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">文</span> depicts the tattoo or body painting placed on the chest of a front‑facing figure. Such designs—shapes like a heart, cross, or chevron—were painted in fresh cinnabar on the bodies of the dead as potent ritual adornment: charms to keep the soul from slipping away, ward off intrusive spirits, and pray for revival. From this sacred practice, <span class="kanji-inline">文</span> came to signify a beautifully adorned figure or pattern, coloring and decoration. Related characters preserve this ritual background: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="産.html">産</a> portrays rites surrounding birth; <span class="kanji-inline">彥</span> combines <span class="kanji-inline">文</span> with a brow mark and hairlines to show the coming‑of‑age tattoo on the forehead of a youth; <span class="kanji-inline">爽</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">爾</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">奭</span> depict vivid vermilion motifs set symmetrically on the breasts, hence senses like clarity, brightness, and beauty (<span class="kanji-inline">爾</span> being the bust portion of <span class="kanji-inline">爽</span>). Characters that add <span class="kanji-inline">彡</span> underscore the luster and elegance of such body decoration. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="章.html">章</a> represents the ink‑charged tip of a tattoo needle; paired with <span class="kanji-inline">文</span> it yields <span class="kanji-inline">文</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="章.html">章</a>, which extends the idea of patterned adornment to the realm of composed expression, and through <span class="kanji-inline">文</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="字.html">字</a> to the notions of characters, writing, and words.</p>
