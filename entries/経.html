    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">經</span>, this is a phono-semantic compound with <span class="kanji-inline">巠</span> as the phonetic. In ancient form, <span class="kanji-inline">巠</span> depicts the warp on a loom: threads drawn taut and spread by a horizontal bar added at the base, so the graph itself points to the warp. Set against <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="緯.html">緯</a>, the woof, the pair <span class="kanji-inline">経</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="緯.html">緯</a> came to mean the warp and woof and, by extension, the course and governing principles of matters. From this sense of an ordered course arise uses like passing through events (keika) and direct experience (keiken). Because weaving begins by setting the warp—the framework on which all work proceeds—the character also develops meanings of managing and conducting affairs (keiei) and initiating operations (keishi). In the realm of learning, <span class="kanji-inline">経</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="書.html">書</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">経</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="典.html">典</a> name the Confucian classics as foundational, primary texts. Hence its common senses include the warp or vertical, to pass or go through, to manage or run, and by extension a basis or rule.</p>
