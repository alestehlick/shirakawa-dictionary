    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Ritually grounded in origin, <span class="kanji-inline">儒</span> is a phono-semantic compound: the person element (<span class="kanji-inline">亻</span>) combines with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="需.html">需</a> as its phonetic. The graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="需.html">需</a> itself joins <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="雨.html">雨</a> “rain” with <span class="kanji-inline">而</span>, the figure of a person with shorn hair and no topknot—a sign of shamanic function—evoking the rite of praying for rain even under clear skies. From this rain-invocation comes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="需.html">需</a>’s senses “to demand” and “to wait,” and by extension <span class="kanji-inline">儒</span> first named those shamans who performed such ceremonies. These were lower-ranking ritual specialists who also handled and calculated the arrangements for the funerals of wealthy families. Out of this milieu emerged Confucius (6th–5th century BCE), who articulated a universal Way and set in motion what became <span class="kanji-inline">儒</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="教.html">教</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">儒</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="学.html">学</a>; thereafter <span class="kanji-inline">儒</span> came to denote Confucian teaching and the scholars who embody it.</p>
