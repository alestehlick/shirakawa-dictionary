    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Composed of the water element and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="歩.html">歩</a> (“to step”), <span class="kanji-inline">渉</span> originally pictured stepping into a current to make a ford—hence the sense of wading and crossing. Because river crossings were hazardous, such fording could be imposed on outsiders as an ordeal, and it also acquired a ritual character. Early forms connected with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="順.html">順</a> even show <span class="kanji-inline">渉</span> combined with <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span>, the head bearing a ritual cap, to depict a figure bowing in reverence to a spirit at a crossing place. Fords thus served not only as practical passage points but also as sites of ceremony, and the character preserves this image of deliberate passage through water.</p>
