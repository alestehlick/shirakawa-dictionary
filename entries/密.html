    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa sees <span class="kanji-inline">密</span> as a compound graph of <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">必</span>, and the idea of fire. <span class="kanji-inline">宀</span> sketches the roof of a mausoleum where ancestors are revered. <span class="kanji-inline">必</span> originally depicts the head of a weapon—either a pike (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>) or broad axe—fixed to its shaft; in bronze inscriptions for <span class="kanji-inline">密</span> this element appears explicitly as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="戈.html">戈</a>. The character portrays a private rite in which a pike is placed within the mausoleum as a curse-warding implement, then exorcised and purified by fire to calm and pacify the ancestral spirits. Because the ceremony was conducted in hushed secrecy, the graph came to signify “secret, private,” and by extension “closely packed, detailed.” Shirakawa also notes the related graph <span class="kanji-inline">秘</span>, which shows offering a <span class="kanji-inline">必</span> in divine worship; together the pair forms <span class="kanji-inline">秘</span><span class="kanji-inline">密</span>, the notion of what is deliberately kept from sight.</p>
