    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">創</span> as a phonetic compound: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="倉.html">倉</a> serves as the sound element (sou), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a> is the blade. In archaic usage the word referred to a wound, especially the gash made by a spear or lance. Alongside it there once existed a separate graph that pictured opening the frame of a casting mold (<span class="kanji-inline">井</span>) with a knife to take out the vessel inside; from that image came the senses “to begin” and “to create.” That older character fell out of use, and <span class="kanji-inline">創</span>, originally the “wound” graph, absorbed its meanings. Variant forms such as <span class="kanji-inline">刱</span> are also attested.</p>
