    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">碁</span> is a phonetic–semantic character: the stone radical points to the black and white stones used in the game, while <span class="kanji-inline">其</span> serves as the phonetic element, as also seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="期.html">期</a> (“time”), which shares the same sound series. The character denotes the game played on a square board ruled with nineteen lines each way, known poetically as <span class="kanji-inline">烏</span><span class="kanji-inline">鷺</span> (“crow and heron”) for the contrast of black and white stones. The game is attested from the Qin and Former Han periods, and tradition says it was brought to Japan by the envoy Kibi no Makibi in the eighth century. By the Heian era it had also become a pastime for women, a scene memorably depicted in the Tale of Genji picture scrolls.</p>
