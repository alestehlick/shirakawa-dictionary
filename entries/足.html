    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph: the upper part sketches the lower leg with its knee joint, while the element below—originally the footprint form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="止.html">止</a>—shows the foreleg. Rather than depicting the entire limb, the graph isolates the ashi, the foot, by combining the knee with the fore part of the leg. By contrast, <span class="kanji-inline">疋</span> draws the whole lower leg and, by extension, came to be used with the sense of “help,” often interchanged with <span class="kanji-inline">胥</span>. From the concrete notion of the foot, <span class="kanji-inline">足</span> broadened to mean “to suffice, be worthy” and “to add, make up,” and it stands very close to <span class="kanji-inline">疋</span> both in form and in associated sounds and meanings.</p>
