    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the mountain element signals the idea of height, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="宗.html">宗</a> serves as the phonetic, giving the on reading suu and evoking the main, ancestral house—a focus of esteem. The Erya says, “A mountain that is great and high is called <span class="kanji-inline">嵩</span> (suu),” and <span class="kanji-inline">崇</span> appears interchangeably with <span class="kanji-inline">崧</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="高.html">高</a> in that sense. From the image of a towering mountain arose the general meaning “high, lofty,” which, when applied to people and things, naturally extended to “to revere” and “to worship.”</p>
