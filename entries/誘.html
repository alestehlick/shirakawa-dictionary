    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">誘</span> is a phonetic–semantic character: the left side <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="言.html">言</a> contributes the sense of words and prompting, while the right side <span class="kanji-inline">秀</span> acts as the phonetic core that gives the yuu reading and ties the graph to its series (as in <span class="kanji-inline">莠</span>). Classical lexica gloss it as “to mutually stir and set in motion,” from which come the senses of inviting, enticing, urging, and leading. The Zuo Commentary cites <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="天.html">天</a><span class="kanji-inline">誘</span><span class="kanji-inline">其</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="衷.html">衷</a>, “Heaven guides their inner intent,” showing the term’s elevated nuance of drawing minds into harmony. Altogether, <span class="kanji-inline">誘</span> depicts guiding or moving others—often through speech—toward action or accord.</p>
