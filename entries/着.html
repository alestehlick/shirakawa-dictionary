    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="著.html">著</a>, this is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">者</span> providing the sound. Shirakawa explains <span class="kanji-inline">者</span> as depicting an earthen hedge raised to protect a village, into which written charms (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="日.html">日</a>) were buried; by implanting these writings, incantatory power was made to adhere to the barrier. From this ritual sense of making something stick came the meanings “to attach, to adhere,” and by extension “to arrive” and “to put on.” <span class="kanji-inline">着</span> is the popular form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="著.html">著</a> and came to be used for everyday senses such as wearing garments and arriving (chaku), while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="著.html">著</a> (cho) developed literary senses like “clear, manifest” and “to write and publish.”</p>
