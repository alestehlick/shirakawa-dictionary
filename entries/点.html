    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">點</span>, this is a phono-semantic character built with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="占.html">占</a> as the phonetic, which also underlies characters like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="店.html">店</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">坫</span> and carries the on reading ten. Alongside its phonetic role, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="占.html">占</a> evoked a narrow spot set aside to place wine cups—a small, delimited place—giving the character its core sense of a tiny mark or speck, as in a black spot or the series of dots in a dotted line. From the idea of making a small mark came the scholarly uses of adding or adjusting dots in manuscripts (as in emendation and correction). The sense of applying a small, precise amount extends to instilling drops (eye drops, medicines) and, by transferring the notion of a momentary point of ignition, to lighting or switching on fires and lamps. It further developed into the idea of tallying and marks of evaluation, hence scores and points, and even appears in cultural contexts such as preparing powdered tea.</p>
