    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character in which <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="苗.html">苗</a> functions as the phonetic, pointing to a byō-type sound. It is not seen in the earliest inscriptional materials. The Yuan-period Liù Shū Gù notes that its sound is close to <span class="kanji-inline">摸</span> and glosses it as “to copy.” In practice it means to draw or paint and, by extension, to write; at its core it evokes the brush’s sketching lines that give shape to a form—the quick, formative strokes of a draft.</p>
