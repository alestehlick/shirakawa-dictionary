    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character’s original form is <span class="kanji-inline">與</span>, built by combining <span class="kanji-inline">与</span>—probably depicting a pair of ivory tusks—with the hand graphs <span class="kanji-inline">臼</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">廾</span>, each showing a pair of hands. <span class="kanji-inline">與</span> thus portrays four hands lifting and carrying precious goods such as ivory. From this image of jointly bearing a load arise senses of acting together—participating, sharing, keeping company—and, by extension, transferring something to another place, hence to give. Related forms illuminate the scene: <span class="kanji-inline">輿</span> shows hands at the four corners carrying a hand-cart, while <span class="kanji-inline">興</span> shows a wine vessel held with both hands, supported from below by two more, pouring a libation to rouse the spirits of the earth. In this light, <span class="kanji-inline">與</span> itself reflects a rite of bestowal or granting, which also underlies uses like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="関.html">関</a><span class="kanji-inline">与</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">与</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="聞.html">聞</a>, where the sense is to take part or be concerned.</p>
