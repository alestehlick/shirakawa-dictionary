    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the oracle-bone and bronze inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">買</span> combines the net radical <span class="kanji-inline">网</span> with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="貝.html">貝</a>, the cowrie shells that served as wealth. It depicts gathering shells with a net—an image of acquiring valuables—and so came to mean “to buy,” with a nuance of quietly amassing shells. The Shuowen likewise glosses it as “to buy.” Relatedly, the old form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="売.html">売</a> was written <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="費.html">費</a>, a graph joining <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="出.html">出</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">買</span> to express spending or releasing the shells one has obtained. From this core sense of acquisition, <span class="kanji-inline">買</span> also extends to “bringing upon oneself” or “inviting,” as in baishu (<span class="kanji-inline">買</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="愁.html">愁</a>), “to invite sorrow.”</p>
