    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">籍</span> takes its sound from <span class="kanji-inline">藉</span> (seki). The older graphic core is the plow element with feet pressing on it, expressing the act of treading and turning the earth to break it finely; this part incorporates <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="昔.html">昔</a>, which originally depicted thinly sliced dried meat heaped up, evoking the idea of cutting into small pieces. With the bamboo classifier <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="竹.html">竹</a> added, the character points to thinly split bamboo slats used as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="竹.html">竹</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="簡.html">簡</a>—writing slips—and, by extension, wooden slips (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="簡.html">簡</a>). Bound together, these made books before paper, so <span class="kanji-inline">籍</span> came to mean writings, documents, and books, and by further development the act of recording. The graph is also used interchangeably with <span class="kanji-inline">藉</span> in the sense ‘to borrow.’</p>
