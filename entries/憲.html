    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="審.html">審</a> as its phonetic, <span class="kanji-inline">憲</span> ultimately grows out of the older graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="審.html">審</a>. In that graph, the upper element is the same as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="害.html">害</a>, an image of a large handled needle, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="審.html">審</a> depicts the act of marking a punitive tattoo above the eyes—hence the sense of punishment. Early Zhou bronze inscriptions, from around 3,300 years ago, even mention a person named <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="審.html">審</a>, apparently an official responsible for carrying out punishments. From this base, <span class="kanji-inline">憲</span> came to mean the rules and law that set things right through penal correction, and by extension took on the senses of regulation, example, and model—captured in the Book of Odes phrase <span class="kanji-inline">萬</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="邦.html">邦</a><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="為.html">為</a><span class="kanji-inline">憲</span>, “a model for all the states.”</p>
