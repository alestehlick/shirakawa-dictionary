    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph: the component <span class="kanji-inline">舟</span> ‘ship’ provides the meaning, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="監.html">監</a> (On reading kan) supplies the sound. Medieval lexica describe it as a ship fitted with a plank-built “house” on deck—an enclosed structure erected to protect against arrows—hence a purpose-built warship. Such vessels became prominent from the Three Kingdoms period, when campaigns were waged across the broad Yangtze. The phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="監.html">監</a>, ancestral to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="鑑.html">鑑</a>, originally referred to a large water basin used as a ‘water mirror,’ and here contributes both its sound and a water-bound resonance to the character’s formation.</p>
