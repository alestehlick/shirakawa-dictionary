    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">癒</span> is a phono-semantic character built on the graph <span class="kanji-inline">兪</span> (yu), which provides the sound and the core image. In <span class="kanji-inline">兪</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="舟.html">舟</a> is not a boat but a tub or shallow vessel, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a> is the form of a handled surgical knife; together they depict lancing an abscess so that pus and blood drain into a tub—an act that restores the body, hence “to heal” and “to recover.” The related graphs <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="愉.html">愉</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">愈</span> (yu) likewise speak of a wound or illness mending and the mind settling into ease. When <span class="kanji-inline">愈</span> later broadened to mean “to surpass; ever more,” the “sickbed” radical <span class="kanji-inline">疒</span>—shaped like a patient lying on a bed—was added to create <span class="kanji-inline">癒</span>, making the sense of recovery from illness explicit. The Shuowen glosses the cognate <span class="kanji-inline">瘉</span> (yu) as “a sickness heals,” and ancient Chinese medicine already practiced operative treatment with narcotics—the very procedure the graph evokes.</p>
