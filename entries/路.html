    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">路</span> as a phono-semantic character. Its phonetic, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="各.html">各</a>, originally depicts the covenant casket (sai) that holds written petitions, used in rites to summon the gods to descend in answer to prayer. With <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="足.html">足</a>, “foot/steps,” added, the whole points to the path along which the descending gods proceed—hence the Shuowen gloss “way.” He further links <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="道.html">道</a> to a ritually purified space empowered to expel malevolent forces, so <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="道.html">道</a><span class="kanji-inline">路</span> is a roadway purified and protected by such ritual power. From this sacred origin comes the honorific use of <span class="kanji-inline">路</span> in compounds relating to the Son of Heaven or feudal lords, such as <span class="kanji-inline">路</span><span class="kanji-inline">車</span> (a lord’s carriage) and <span class="kanji-inline">路</span><span class="kanji-inline">寝</span> (a palace). Related graphs like <span class="kanji-inline">賂</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">輅</span> share the phonetic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="各.html">各</a>; <span class="kanji-inline">輅</span> in particular denotes the ruler’s carriage. In origin, then, <span class="kanji-inline">路</span> is the “way of divine descent,” later generalized to mean a road or route.</p>
