    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">械</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a>, suggesting a wooden implement, with <span class="kanji-inline">戒</span> as the phonetic element that gives the reading kai and a sense of restraint. Early definitions make it “shackles” (kase), punitive restraints for the hands and feet. From this core it broadened to mean implements and contrivances, and in classical military contexts it denotes war machines: in Sunzi’s chapter On Planning an Attack, one prepares <span class="kanji-inline">器</span> (tools) and <span class="kanji-inline">械</span> (machines), with <span class="kanji-inline">器</span><span class="kanji-inline">械</span> serving as a general term for offensive and defensive equipment. In later usage the standard word for a machine is <span class="kanji-inline">機</span><span class="kanji-inline">械</span>—<span class="kanji-inline">機</span> being originally a loom—capturing the idea of a system working by parts fitted together; since <span class="kanji-inline">器</span> at root names ritual vessels, <span class="kanji-inline">機</span><span class="kanji-inline">械</span> is the more fitting spelling.</p>
