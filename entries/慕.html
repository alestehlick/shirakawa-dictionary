    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic (picto-phonetic) character: the original form is <span class="kanji-inline">慕</span>, with <span class="kanji-inline">莫</span> serving as the phonetic element that gives the On reading bo, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a> underneath supplying the sense of the heart. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">莫</span> also evokes nuances such as searching or a grove, images that blend into feelings of longing and thought. Joined with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="心.html">心</a>, it portrays a heart that seeks, yearns, and loves. Hence <span class="kanji-inline">慕</span> means to yearn for, to long for in love, and to think fondly of. Mencius (Wan Zhang, Part I) illustrates this innate impulse: in childhood, people cling to their parents.</p>
