    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character formed with the speech element and the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">咨</span>. The phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">咨</span> originally evoked lamenting prayers addressed to the deities—complaining, grieving, and inquiring. As <span class="kanji-inline">咨</span> came to be used chiefly for lamentation (as in shisa, “to lament”), a new graph with the speech radical was created to carry the sense of seeking counsel through words. With shi as its on reading, <span class="kanji-inline">諮</span> expresses speaking out a matter in complaint and inquiry, hence “to consult” (hakaru).</p>
