    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phonetic-semantic character: the water element points to a watery setting, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="白.html">白</a> acts as the phonetic, yielding the on reading haku. Early dictionaries gloss it as shallow water, and later as the calm stretch where a ship halts—an anchorage suitable for dropping anchor (as in teihaku, anchoring). From that scene grows its uses: to stop for the night, to lodge, to remain. It also appears in literary phrases such as <span class="kanji-inline">泊</span><span class="kanji-inline">然</span> (hakuzen), evoking a mind tranquil and unruffled like still water.</p>
