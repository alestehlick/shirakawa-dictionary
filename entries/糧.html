    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">糧</span> is a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="米.html">米</a> supplies the sense of grain or rice, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="量.html">量</a> provides the sound ryō. In its older form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="量.html">量</a> depicts a sack with a spout used to measure out cereals and also means “to measure.” Joined with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="米.html">米</a>, it evokes measuring rice by the sack, and thus came to mean a fixed allowance of food—provisions—especially the food one carried when traveling. From this developed the broader sense of sustenance or rations. The character is also written <span class="kanji-inline">粮</span>.</p>
