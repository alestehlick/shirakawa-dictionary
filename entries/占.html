    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character joins <span class="kanji-inline">卜</span>, the crack traced in pyromancy, with a receptacle sign written like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a>, the vessel that held covenant slips offered in prayer. In tortoise-shell divination a long slot and a conical pit were drilled on the reverse of the plastron; when heat was applied, a fissure sprang on the front—<span class="kanji-inline">卜</span> depicts that fissure. <span class="kanji-inline">占</span> therefore portrays offering prayer and reading the crack to ask the gods’ will, and oracle-bone inscriptions even use a plastron-shaped variant in formulas such as “the king divined and said…,” confirming its original sense “to divine.” Because a verdict obtained through divination was taken as absolute, the word later developed the meanings “to occupy,” “to hold,” and by extension “to monopolize.”</p>
