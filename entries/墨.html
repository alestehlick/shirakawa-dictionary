    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">墨</span> is a compound graph combining <span class="kanji-inline">黑</span>, “black,” with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a>, “earth.” In Shirakawa’s view, <span class="kanji-inline">黑</span> evoked a fire-blackened sack producing soot, and <span class="kanji-inline">墨</span> names the substance made by mixing that soot with earth—at times even lacquer—kneading it into solid cakes of ink. In divination practice, characters were first brushed in ink on tortoise plastrons and bones before being carved; examples of these ink traces still survive. Because the same ink was used for punitive tattooing, the character also came to mean “tattoo,” and by extension it can denote “black.”</p>
