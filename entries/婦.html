    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In early inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">婦</span> appears with the broom graph <span class="kanji-inline">帚</span>—a ritual implement of split twigs sprinkled with fragrant wine—used to sweep and purify the ancestral hall. In oracle-bone texts <span class="kanji-inline">帚</span> can even stand for <span class="kanji-inline">婦</span>, underscoring their association in sound and function. While <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="掃.html">掃</a> depicts the act of wielding the broom to cleanse and exorcise, <span class="kanji-inline">婦</span> names the woman charged with this sacred work: the wife who, upon entering a new household, becomes part of its lineage and serves its ancestral spirits as the household’s leading woman. Oracle-bone inscriptions record women titled <span class="kanji-inline">婦</span>, such as Fu Hao and Fu Jing, commanding armies, suggesting that in the Yin period figures bearing this title could hold significant public roles. In the Zhou period that public aspect waned, though bronze inscriptions still set husband and wife side by side. Divination records also reflect concerns over the spiritual rapport within the family, often asking whether a mother-in-law’s spirit might bring misfortune upon the new wife—evidence of how deeply the role signified by <span class="kanji-inline">婦</span> was tied to ancestral service and ritual purification.</p>
