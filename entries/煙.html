    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">煙</span> is a phono-semantic character. The left component <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="火.html">火</a>, “fire,” signals the sense of smoke. On the right is the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">垔</span>, built from <span class="kanji-inline">亞</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a>: it depicts a clay cooking stove with a side flue (the vent indicated by the element written <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="西.html">西</a>), the whole enveloped in smoke that drifts outward. This phonetic provides the on reading en and also appears in characters like <span class="kanji-inline">湮</span>, where it carries the idea of being shrouded or buried, reinforcing the image of smoke that covers and obscures. From the scene of a smoking stove, <span class="kanji-inline">煙</span> came to mean thick smoke itself and, by extension, anything with a smoke-like appearance—haze, vapor, or mist.</p>
