    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">甫</span> as its phonetic, giving the On reading ho. Shirakawa notes that <span class="kanji-inline">甫</span> depicts a young tree with its roots, carrying the sense of something enveloped within. The character as a whole denotes the edge of water: as the Shuowen says, the waterside. More specifically, it evokes the rounded recess of a coastline—a creek, inlet, or small bay (ura)—and by extension is also used for the beach or shore and the waterside in general.</p>
