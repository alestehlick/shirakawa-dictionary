    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, <span class="kanji-inline">原</span> is a pictograph of water spilling from a cliff (the cliff shown by <span class="kanji-inline">厂</span>), the falling stream marking the headwaters of a mountain river. From this image it first meant “source, origin,” and by extension the “beginning” and “basis” of things. Its use for “field, plain” (as in <span class="kanji-inline">原</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="野.html">野</a>) arose by graphic substitution for an older character that depicted a ritual hunt on open grassland: <span class="kanji-inline">夂</span> signifies the descent of a deity, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="田.html">田</a> the mesh of a hunting net, and <span class="kanji-inline">彖</span> an animal, forming a scene of prayer for hunting success held out on the steppe. Because such rites took place on the grassland (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="草.html">草</a><span class="kanji-inline">原</span>), that graph came to mean “field,” and in common writing <span class="kanji-inline">原</span> assumed that sense. To state “source” explicitly, a new water-sign form, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="源.html">源</a>, was then created with <span class="kanji-inline">氵</span> added to <span class="kanji-inline">原</span>.</p>
