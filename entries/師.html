    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In the earliest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">師</span> brings together the altar sign and a special knife to show a military rite. Before a campaign, meat was offered at an ancestral or army shrine, prayers for victory were made, and a portion of this consecrated meat—regarded as the army’s protective spirit—was carried with the force. At encampments an altar was set up to enshrine it, a scene reflected by the altar element; when such an altar is shown within a building, it yields the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="官.html">官</a>. The component depicted as a knife with a blood‑stopping guard indicates the cutting and apportioning of the offering. <span class="kanji-inline">師</span> thus originally evoked the authorized division of this sacred meat, a prerogative of the commander; from this it came to mean the general, then the army as a whole, and, when forces moved in separate detachments, a “division.” In later times, as clan elders who had led in war took on the role of guiding the young, the word naturally extended to the sense of “teacher.”</p>
