    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of a human ghost or demon, marked off from the living by its large head. In oracle-bone forms, some graphs omit the later cloud mark and instead show dripping dots, evoking the purification and exorcism performed by pouring perfumed wine. Other early forms add the altar sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="示.html">示</a>, originally a ritual table set out for worship. The small stroke group later written like ム seems to depict clouds (<span class="kanji-inline">云</span>), and in subsequent development this line contributes to the graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="魂.html">魂</a> for the human soul. <span class="kanji-inline">鬼</span> thus names the ghost of a person, while <span class="kanji-inline">神</span> refers to the gods of the natural world; together they form <span class="kanji-inline">鬼</span><span class="kanji-inline">神</span>, “ghosts and deities,” the realm of the departed among the divine.</p>
