    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">壤</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: the earth sign <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> provides the field of meaning, while <span class="kanji-inline">襄</span> serves as the phonetic and carries an image. <span class="kanji-inline">襄</span> depicts the collar of a funerary robe packed with ritual objects—two sai, receptacles for vows to the gods, and four “curse tools”—so that the chest swells outward. Applied to earth, this sense of gentle swelling evokes soil that has been turned once and rises softly after plowing, hence the meanings of soil and land. The same phonetic’s nuance of fullness also appears in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="嬢.html">嬢</a>, a woman of rounded form, and in <span class="kanji-inline">穰</span>/<span class="kanji-inline">穣</span>, the abundance of a rich harvest.</p>
