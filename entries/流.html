    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">流</span> as a compound formed from two instances of water and the graph <span class="kanji-inline">夼</span> (totsu), which depicts a child with disheveled hair held upside down. Together they picture an infant swept along in a river, giving the core senses “to flow, be carried away,” and, by extension, “to let flow, to pour.” Related water graphs finely distinguish what the current does: <span class="kanji-inline">氾</span> marks a drowned body floating face-down, <span class="kanji-inline">泛</span> floating face-up, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="浮.html">浮</a> shows the act of trying to lift a fallen child from above. He also notes an ancient custom in which a newborn might be briefly set adrift before a decision to raise it—an unsettling practice that nonetheless clarifies the character’s imagery. From the idea of those borne along together, <span class="kanji-inline">流</span> further came to signify a circle or lineage, as in meiryū (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="名.html">名</a><span class="kanji-inline">流</span>), a “celebrity” counted among a distinguished set.</p>
