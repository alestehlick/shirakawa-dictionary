    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character is originally written <span class="kanji-inline">殼</span>, formed from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="吉.html">吉</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span>. Here <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="吉.html">吉</a> depicts a cereal ear whose kernels have already been removed, while <span class="kanji-inline">殳</span> is a long striking implement, the cane-like pike that conveys the act of beating. Together they picture threshing—beating the ears to strip away the outer layers—so that what remains is only the husk or shell. The small element at the lower left can be read as fragments of the spent grain. From this scene the word takes the sense of husk, shell, crust, and chaff. When the grain radical <span class="kanji-inline">禾</span> is added to this base, it yields <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="穀.html">穀</a>, shifting the focus to the cereals themselves, full with grain.</p>
