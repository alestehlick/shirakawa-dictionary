    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">酪</span> is a phono-semantic character: the <span class="kanji-inline">酉</span> element evokes fermented liquids and foods, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="各.html">各</a> acts as the phonetic, giving the on reading raku, as seen also in <span class="kanji-inline">洛</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="絡.html">絡</a>. The Shuowen Xinfu glosses it as nyusho, milk boiled down or condensed into a drink or curd—essentially fermented milk or cheese. The word belongs to the food culture of stock-breeding peoples, and an early Han citation from Li Ling mentions subsisting on mutton and a milk drink (<span class="kanji-inline">酪</span><span class="kanji-inline">漿</span>) to stave off hunger and thirst. From this core sense of curdled or fermented milk comes the modern term <span class="kanji-inline">酪</span><span class="kanji-inline">農</span>, “dairy farming.”</p>
