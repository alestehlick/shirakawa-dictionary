    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">樣</span>, this is a phono-semantic character: <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="木.html">木</a> “tree” supplies the semantic base, while the phonetic <span class="kanji-inline">羕</span> (yo)—denoting water that drifts and flows on in a long vein—gives the sound. The idea is of water-like lines traced in wood grain, which naturally suggests a pattern or outward aspect. From this image come meanings such as form, mode, and appearance, seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">樣</span><span class="kanji-inline">式</span> (form, style) and <span class="kanji-inline">様</span><span class="kanji-inline">子</span> (state, appearance). In Japanese it also reads sama, used after names as a respectful title equivalent to “Mr., Esq.”</p>
