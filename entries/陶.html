    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">陶</span> is a phono-semantic character with <span class="kanji-inline">匋</span> as its phonetic. In early writing, <span class="kanji-inline">匋</span> depicts an earthen jar (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="缶.html">缶</a>) set into a kiln (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="窯.html">窯</a>) for firing. The left element <span class="kanji-inline">阝</span> marks the sacred precinct associated with the gods’ ladder, the place by which deities ascend and descend. Together they portray pottery being fired before that holy site—vessels made as offerings to the gods—hence the core sense “pottery, ceramic ware.” From this ritual scene the meaning broadened to pottery in general, and then figuratively to the idea of shaping and nurturing—“to cultivate, to train”—as seen in <span class="kanji-inline">陶</span><span class="kanji-inline">育</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">陶</span><span class="kanji-inline">冶</span>; it also appears in expressions for being carried away or weighed down in feeling, as in <span class="kanji-inline">陶</span><span class="kanji-inline">酔</span> “rapt intoxication” and <span class="kanji-inline">鬱</span><span class="kanji-inline">陶</span> “gloom.”</p>
