    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">崎</span> pairs the mountain determinative with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奇.html">奇</a> as its phonetic. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奇.html">奇</a> signals the On reading ki and also evokes a sense of leaning or instability. Set against the mountain element, the graph first pictured treacherous, steep places in the hills—a difficult, precipitous path—and by extension terrain marked by abrupt changes. From this grew its topographical use for land that juts into the water, hence saki/misaki “cape, promontory,” as seen in place names like Nagasaki. Related forms such as <span class="kanji-inline">埼</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">碕</span> are used with the same coastal sense, and because of its <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奇.html">奇</a> phonetic, <span class="kanji-inline">崎</span> can at times substitute for other <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="奇.html">奇</a>-based graphs, though in Japan it is chiefly the character for these steep headlands.</p>
