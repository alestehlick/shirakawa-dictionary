    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">頒</span> is a phono-semantic character. The element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="分.html">分</a> supplies the sound (han) and hints at the idea of dividing or sharing, while <span class="kanji-inline">頁</span> depicts a person in ceremonial headgear, bowed in reverence. Together they evoke the formal bestowal of portions at a rite—goods being divided and granted in a dignified, ceremonial setting. This sense lives on in compounds such as <span class="kanji-inline">頒</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="賜.html">賜</a> (to distribute and grant) and <span class="kanji-inline">頒</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="氷.html">氷</a> (to allot portions of ice). In early literature it can also touch the head motif, as in the Shi Jing line about fish among the pondweed, and the graph is sometimes used interchangeably with <span class="kanji-inline">斑</span> in expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">頒</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="白.html">白</a> for hair streaked with white.</p>
