    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A compound graph that brings together <span class="kanji-inline">勹</span>, the side view of a body bent double—originally the drawn-up form of a corpse—and a mouth/enclosure element understood as the sacred receptacle into which covenant texts to the gods were placed. The pairing evokes burial rites for a body with contracted limbs, much like the funerary nuance seen in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="局.html">局</a>. From this image of bending arose usages such as <span class="kanji-inline">句</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="曲.html">曲</a> for stooping or folding, <span class="kanji-inline">句</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="兵.html">兵</a> for a weapon with a hooked edge, and <span class="kanji-inline">句</span><span class="kanji-inline">爪</span> for a raptor’s long, hooked claws. In writing, a small bent stroke was used to mark off sense units, and by extension <span class="kanji-inline">句</span> came to signify a bounded unit of language—hence a clause or phrase, as in <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="語.html">語</a><span class="kanji-inline">句</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="章.html">章</a><span class="kanji-inline">句</span>.</p>
