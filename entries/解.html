    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The character is built from <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="角.html">角</a> (horn), <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="刀.html">刀</a> (knife), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="牛.html">牛</a> (ox), originally depicting the act of cutting an ox’s horns with a knife. In the same semantic field stands <span class="kanji-inline">釈</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">釋</span>), which first meant to cut up a carcass and portion it out—the tearing apart and distribution of meat. From these concrete actions of removing, cutting apart, and dividing, <span class="kanji-inline">解</span> developed its figurative force: to unfasten and unravel what is knotted, to clarify and explain meaning (as in <span class="kanji-inline">解</span><span class="kanji-inline">釈</span>), and, by extension, to resolve questions and problems (as in <span class="kanji-inline">解</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="決.html">決</a>).</p>
