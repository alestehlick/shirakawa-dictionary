    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic graph, <span class="kanji-inline">掌</span> combines the hand/palm element with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="尚.html">尚</a> as its phonetic, which supplies the on-reading shō. The Shuowen glosses it as “the inside of the hand,” evoking the cupped hollow of the palm. Because the palm is the part that grips tightly, the character naturally extends to the idea of taking things firmly in hand: hence expressions such as <span class="kanji-inline">掌</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="握.html">握</a> (to grasp, to command), <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="管.html">管</a><span class="kanji-inline">掌</span> (to manage), and <span class="kanji-inline">掌</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="典.html">典</a> (to take charge of rites or records). In early graphic usage, adding a small indicator above or below the palm sign produced <span class="kanji-inline">上</span> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="下.html">下</a>, marking “above” and “below” with reference to the hand’s orientation.</p>
