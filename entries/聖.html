    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">聖</span> is a compound graph that sets a large ear above the profile of a person standing on tiptoe (the form written as <span class="kanji-inline">壬</span>), together with a mouth and a ritual container for covenant prayers. The enlarged ear highlights hearing: people in antiquity believed the ear could catch the gods’ faint voices. The character thus portrays one who chants prayers, straining upward in devotion and able to hear the deities’ voice and receive their messages—a priestly figure. From this root, related characters such as <span class="kanji-inline">聡</span> came to signify keen discernment of the divine voice, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="聴.html">聴</a> the receptive hearing that brings insight to the heart. In later usage, Confucianism elevated <span class="kanji-inline">聖</span> to the supreme title of “saint,” also extending it to “clever, wise,” and as an honorific associated with the Son of Heaven.</p>
