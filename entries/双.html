    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written as <span class="kanji-inline">雙</span>, the character combines the bird element (<span class="kanji-inline">隹</span>) with the hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>) to depict a hand holding two birds. From this concrete scene it came to mean a matched pair, things set together or in alignment, and by extension simply “two.” In contrast, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="隻.html">隻</a> shows a single bird held in a hand, while the simplified form <span class="kanji-inline">双</span> suggests two hands placed side by side to convey the idea of a pair. Hence expressions like isso, “one pair,” name something that forms a set of two.</p>
