    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">照</span> is a phono-semantic character built on <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="昭.html">昭</a> as its sound and core idea. Shirakawa explains that the older form of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="昭.html">昭</a> was <span class="kanji-inline">邵</span>, a graph depicting the reverent welcoming of a descending ancestral or divine spirit; from this numinous descent made manifest comes the sense of clarity and brightness. To show actual radiance, the fire element was added beneath <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="昭.html">昭</a>, yielding <span class="kanji-inline">照</span>, the shining of light. Classical texts use it in the vivid image “like the shining of the sun and moon,” suggesting illumination reaching in all directions. From the act of making something bright and clear, the character naturally extends to bringing two things into clear relation—correspondence, checking, and verification—and in Japanese it also colors the sense of self-conscious brightness in the intransitive tereru, as in a shy “smile that shows.”</p>
