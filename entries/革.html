    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character began as a picture of an animal skin: the entire hide flayed open from head to limbs and fully worked. In contrast to <span class="kanji-inline">皮</span>, which shows the raw hide being torn off with a hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="又.html">又</a>), <span class="kanji-inline">革</span> depicts the finished product—hair and fat removed, the skin softened—hence its core meaning of leather and the compound <span class="kanji-inline">皮</span><span class="kanji-inline">革</span> for hides and leather. Because tanning so thoroughly remakes the material, <span class="kanji-inline">革</span> naturally came to express renewal and reform, yielding uses such as <span class="kanji-inline">改</span><span class="kanji-inline">革</span> (reform) and <span class="kanji-inline">革</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="命.html">命</a> (a dynastic change or sweeping political and social transformation). A related graph, <span class="kanji-inline">韋</span>, shows a hide hung up to dry; in combination as <span class="kanji-inline">韋</span><span class="kanji-inline">革</span> it specifically refers to tanned leather.</p>
