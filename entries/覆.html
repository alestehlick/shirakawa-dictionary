    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">覆</span> is a phono‑semantic character. The phonetic element <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="復.html">復</a> supplies the on reading fuku (as in hanpuku, “repetition”), while the semantic element <span class="kanji-inline">襾</span> depicts a lid closing the mouth of a vessel, conveying the act of covering. Classical glosses also explain it as “to overturn, capsize,” and early forms show earth piled over a figure lying on its back—an image of covering. Thus the character means to cover, and by extension to turn something over, a nuance reflected in compounds like hanpuku.</p>
