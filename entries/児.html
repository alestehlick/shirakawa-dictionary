    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A pictograph of a human child distinguished by an infant’s hairstyle. As described in the Book of Rites (Nei Ze), boys received the “male-horn” style three months after birth; the ancient form <span class="kanji-inline">兒</span> depicts this agemaki: the hair is parted down the middle and bound into ring-like tufts by the ears that jut out like small horns. A similar outline was imagined for the “female rainbow” <span class="kanji-inline">霓</span>, seen as a two‑headed dragon whose twin heads recall an infant’s hornlike buns. From this vivid image the character naturally came to mean “child, infant.”</p>
