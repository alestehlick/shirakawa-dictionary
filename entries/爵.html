    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its oldest forms, <span class="kanji-inline">爵</span> is a straightforward pictograph of the bronze wine cup known as a jue, its distinctive shape carried into writing just as it was. In antiquity, rewards and investitures were accompanied by the presentation of wine in this vessel; thus the vessel became a symbol of conferred honor. From that ritual setting, the word broadened to signify ranks of nobility themselves, so that <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="公.html">公</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="侯.html">侯</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="伯.html">伯</a>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="子.html">子</a>, and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="男.html">男</a> are collectively called the “five <span class="kanji-inline">爵</span>,” and terms like <span class="kanji-inline">爵</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="位.html">位</a> (peerage) and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="公.html">公</a><span class="kanji-inline">爵</span> (duke) reflect this development from sacred cup to title.</p>
