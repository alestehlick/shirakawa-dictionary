    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, <span class="kanji-inline">墜</span> combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="隊.html">隊</a> and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a>. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="隊.html">隊</a> depicts a sacrificial animal set before <span class="kanji-inline">自</span>, whose archaic shape represents the gods’ ladder used for ascent and descent, marking the very spot where deities set foot on earth. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="土.html">土</a> shows a rounded mound of soil raised on a stand, an image of the earth deity. Together they signify worship of the earth god at the place of divine descent; hence <span class="kanji-inline">墜</span> originally meant “earth, land, place,” and even functioned as the predecessor of <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="地.html">地</a>. Only later did <span class="kanji-inline">墜</span> shift to the sense of falling or crashing, with the phono-semantic <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="地.html">地</a> created to carry the meanings of land and place. Beyond “to fall” and “to drop,” <span class="kanji-inline">墜</span> can also mean “to lose,” as in <span class="kanji-inline">失</span><span class="kanji-inline">墜</span>.</p>
