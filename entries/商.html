    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads <span class="kanji-inline">商</span> as a ritual scene. The character combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="辛.html">辛</a>, the large tattooing needle that signified judicial authority, set upon a stand, with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="口.html">口</a> used not as a mouth but as a covenant vessel that held written petitions to the gods. Displaying the punitive needle and placing the covenant receptacle before it evokes a solemn act of prayerful consultation, so the original sense is to seek the will of the deities, to consult. In the oracle-bone inscriptions, <span class="kanji-inline">商</span> is also the formal name of the Shang polity, whose capital is styled <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a><span class="kanji-inline">邑</span><span class="kanji-inline">商</span>, the Great City of Shang. From contexts of prize-giving and compensatory offerings—reciprocal settlements made to redress or conclude matters—the word broadened into the notion of transaction, and in time came to mean selling and trade, hence commerce.</p>
