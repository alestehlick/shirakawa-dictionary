    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">編</span> is a phono-semantic character: the silk thread element signals binding or lacing, while <span class="kanji-inline">扁</span> (hen) serves as the phonetic, its old form depicting a single swing door woven or plaited. The Shuowen describes <span class="kanji-inline">編</span> as “ordering bamboo slips,” that is, threading bamboo or wooden tablets one by one into a sequence. In antiquity these slips were tied with leather thongs, a practice that naturally extended the sense of the character to braiding and knitting, to binding and arranging in order, and, by association, to writings and books—hence the later ideas of compilation and editing.</p>
