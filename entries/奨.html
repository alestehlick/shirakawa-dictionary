    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Shirakawa reads this as a phono-semantic graph. Its original form <span class="kanji-inline">獎</span> takes <span class="kanji-inline">將</span> (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="将.html">将</a>) as the phonetic, and that element itself depicts a hand (<a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="寸.html">寸</a>) presenting a portion of meat—drawn like <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="夕.html">夕</a> with an added stroke reminiscent of the top of <span class="kanji-inline">炙</span>—set upon a legged stand (<span class="kanji-inline">爿</span>). The lower part written as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="大.html">大</a> in the current form goes back to <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="犬.html">犬</a>, indicating a dog offered in sacrifice. Altogether the character portrays the ritual presentation of sacrificial meat to the gods and the attendant worship. From this image of making an offering, the meaning broadened to the general sense of proffering or advancing something—hence to recommend and encourage—and also to help.</p>
