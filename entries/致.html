    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a compound built from <span class="kanji-inline">至</span> and <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span> (<span class="kanji-inline">攵</span>), though in bronze inscriptions it appears as <span class="kanji-inline">至</span> combined with <span class="kanji-inline">人</span>. The graph <span class="kanji-inline">至</span> depicts the point where an arrow comes to rest, the place it has reached. With a person added, the figure expresses someone arriving at that point, giving <span class="kanji-inline">致</span> the sense of “to reach, arrive” and, by extension, “to develop into a certain state.” Bronze texts already use it as a verb meaning “to do, to bring about,” and in later usage its functions differentiated alongside <span class="kanji-inline">到</span>. In compounds such as <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="送.html">送</a><span class="kanji-inline">致</span> it conveys “to send, deliver” and “to carry out,” while in expressions like <span class="kanji-inline">極</span><span class="kanji-inline">致</span>, <span class="kanji-inline">雅</span><span class="kanji-inline">致</span>, and <span class="kanji-inline">風</span><span class="kanji-inline">致</span> it points to what is brought to its highest refinement—a cultivated excellence or tasteful quality attained by thorough mastery.</p>
