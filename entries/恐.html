    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>This character is a phono-semantic compound: its phonetic element signals the on reading kyo, while its form depicts a ritual scene. In the ancient graph, a shaman lifts a curse implement with both hands in a rite to invite the gods, an act performed in awe and trembling before the divine. From this image of sacred dread and self-abasement arose the sense of fearing the gods; in later usage it extended to ordinary fear and respectful reserve toward people and things, giving meanings such as osoreru (to fear) and the respectful stance akin to kashikomaru.</p>
