    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character built with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="兄.html">兄</a> as its phonetic core. The graph <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="兄.html">兄</a>, which supplies the reading kyo, originally portrayed the eldest son who presides over ancestral worship. In that ritual setting, the <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="祝.html">祝</a> (hafuri), a shaman-priest, serves the deities and encounters them as they descend in response to prayer. The term shokyo evokes that entranced, ease-filled consciousness at the moment of divine descent, which became the model for jokyo, “state” or “situation.” In this way, <span class="kanji-inline">況</span> came to express the aspect or condition of things.</p>
