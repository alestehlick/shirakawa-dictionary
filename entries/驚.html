    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character: the horse element <span class="kanji-inline">馬</span> supplies the sense, while <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="敬.html">敬</a> serves as the phonetic and also evokes the ritual act of admonishing—originally even striking—a supplicant. Because horses are especially quick to startle, the graph pictures a horse thrown into alarm, and so it comes to mean being surprised, frightened, or filled with wonder. The word <span class="kanji-inline">駭</span>, seen in the compound <span class="kanji-inline">驚</span><span class="kanji-inline">駭</span>, likewise originally referred to a startled horse.</p>
