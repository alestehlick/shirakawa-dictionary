    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>In its earliest form, this character sketches a handled carving tool: the upper part is the grip, and below it a bent, cutting blade. It parallels the shape of an ancient wood-boring drill used for engraving; a related form, later written <span class="kanji-inline">录</span>, evokes the cascade of wood shavings that fall as one drills. <span class="kanji-inline">克</span> depicts the implement used to gouge and cut deeply into wood, and because such a tool enables the craftsman to work cleanly and effectively, the character came to signify successful mastery—hence meanings such as to do well, to overcome, and to win.</p>
