    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>A phono-semantic character, <span class="kanji-inline">坊</span> takes <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="方.html">方</a> as its phonetic, which also evokes the notion of dividing space into squares. Inside walled cities, streets were laid out in a jōri grid of square sections, and each section was a <span class="kanji-inline">坊</span> with its own “block name” (<span class="kanji-inline">坊</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="名.html">名</a>). From this base sense it came to mean a ward or town and, by extension, a place of commerce, as seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">坊</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="市.html">市</a> (market town), <span class="kanji-inline">坊</span><span class="kanji-inline">肆</span> (shop), and <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="酒.html">酒</a><span class="kanji-inline">坊</span> (liquor shop). Temple precincts were similarly partitioned into <span class="kanji-inline">坊</span>, so the character can also refer to a temple and, more specifically, to monastic living quarters (<span class="kanji-inline">坊</span><span class="kanji-inline">舎</span>, <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="僧.html">僧</a><span class="kanji-inline">坊</span>) and their head (<span class="kanji-inline">坊</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="主.html">主</a>).</p>
