    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p><span class="kanji-inline">窒</span> is a phono-semantic character with <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="至.html">至</a> as its sound-bearing element. <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="至.html">至</a> originally depicts an arrow that has come to rest at its mark, and in ritual context the arrow functions as a curse tool. The graph expresses that arrow being stopped and plugged, yielding the sense of closing or stopping up. Ancient glosses already define it as ‘to close, to stop up’ (<span class="kanji-inline">塞</span>ぐ), and from this core idea come the meanings of choking and suffocation.</p>
