    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>Originally written <span class="kanji-inline">敍</span>, the character combines <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span>. Shirakawa reads <a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="余.html">余</a> as the image of a large needle with a handle, and <span class="kanji-inline">攴</span> as a hand wielding a twig-like implement. Together they portray pricking with a large needle to draw out pus and relieve an illness. From this act of easing and restoring, the sense shifted to putting things in proper order and telling them in sequence—hence meanings such as stating or describing in order, seen in compounds like <span class="kanji-inline">叙</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="述.html">述</a> and <span class="kanji-inline">叙</span><a class="kanji-link kanji-inline" href="録.html">録</a>.</p>
